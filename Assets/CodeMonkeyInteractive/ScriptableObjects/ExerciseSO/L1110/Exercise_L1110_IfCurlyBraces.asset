  exerciseText: This code has an issue where the second instruction does not run
    if the condition is true, fix that.
  hintText: Remember what code blocks are used for.
  solutionText: "if (state) {\r\n    ExerciseValidate();\r\n    ExerciseValidate();\r\n}"
  completedText: 'You learned how if you don''t include a code block for an if then
    only the very next line of code is included in that if.

    In order to avoid
    a ton of confusion I recommend you always write the if code blocks, even if you
    only have one instruction inside it.
