  exerciseText: 'Write a condition that includes ReallyExpensiveFunction(); but doesn''t
    actually run it

    Hint: Short-circuit

'
  hintText: Remember how conditions can short-circuit, meaning some parts won't run
    if they do not affect the final result.
  solutionText: if (true || ReallyExpensiveFunction())
  completedText: 'In this exercise you learned how condition short-circuits work.

    If
    you have an OR and the first condition is true it does not matter what the second
    one is

    If you have an AND and the first condition is false it does not matter
    what the second one is.
