  exerciseText: Use reflection to cycle through all the Functions of the Player class
    and do a Debug.Log with their Name.
  hintText: To get the System.Type object you can use typeof(ClassName); Then you
    can explore the functions on that type object to get all kinds of things. Also
    remember how the technical term for functions in C# is Methods.
  solutionText: "foreach (MethodInfo methodInfo in typeof(Player).GetMethods()) {\r\n   
    Debug.Log(methodInfo.Name);\r\n}"
  completedText: Here you learned how to use reflection to cycle through all the
    functions in a class. With that MethodInfo object you can then do all kinds of
    things.
