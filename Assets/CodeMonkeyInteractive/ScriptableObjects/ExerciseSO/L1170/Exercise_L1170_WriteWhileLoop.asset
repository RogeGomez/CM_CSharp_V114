  exerciseText: 'Write a <b>while</b> loop that runs <b>3</b> times, inside the loop
    call the function <b>Loop();</b>

    Run the scene to test the code

    Be
    careful not to write an <b>infinite loop</b> or Unity will <b>crash!</b>'
  hintText: 'Remember the syntax for the while loop with the while keyword, the condition
    and the code block.

    In order to run it X number of times you need to keep
    track of how many times the loop has ran and set the condition to stop after
    X times.'

  completedText: 'Here you learned to write a simple while loop, the most basic loop
    type.

    Also you made sure to be careful not to write an infinite loop.'
