  exerciseName: Polymorphism
  exerciseTitle: Polymorphism
  exerciseText: Define a function MoveUnit(); that has a parameter that should work
    with either a Player or Enemy or anything that extends Unit.
  hintText: If a function receives a parameter of a base type, then it will work
    when called with any object of any type that extends that base type.
  solutionText: public void MoveUnit(Unit unit) { }
  completedText: Here you learned how polymorphism works, meaning how one object
    can be used as being of a related type.
