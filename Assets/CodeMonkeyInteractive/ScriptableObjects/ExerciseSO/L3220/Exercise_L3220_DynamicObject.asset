  exerciseTitle: Dynamic Object
  exerciseText: Make a function called TestObject that receives a dynamic parameter.
    Then inside it try to call a Test function inside that object. But make sure
    it does NOT throw an exception if the object doesn't have a Test function.
  hintText: Use the dynamic keyword on the parameter and call the function, but use
    a try catch to ensure it doesn't throw an exception.
  solutionText: "public void TestObject(dynamic objectDynamic) {\r\n    try {\r\n       
    objectDynamic.Test();\r\n    } catch { }\r\n}"
  completedText: In this exercise you learned how to use dynamic. Note how Visual
    Studio did not give you auto-suggestions because by using dynamic it means the
    type can be anything.
