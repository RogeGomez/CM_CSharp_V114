  exerciseTitle: Define and Create a 2D Array
  exerciseText: 'Define a 2D array of ints with 3 length on first dimension and 4
    on the second dimension

    Then set the value on index [0,2] to 56

    Return
    the array from the function'
  hintText: 'Remember the difference between multidimensional arrays and arrays of
    arrays. Create a 2D multidimensional array with the correct dimension properties.

    Then
    access the index like in a normal array and set the new value.'
  solutionText: 'int[,] int2DArray = new int[3, 4];

    int2DArray[0, 2] = 56;'
  completedText: Here you learned how to define a multidimensional array. This is
    a really useful data type when you have something like a grid you want to represent.
    And remember how you can have as many dimensions as you want!
