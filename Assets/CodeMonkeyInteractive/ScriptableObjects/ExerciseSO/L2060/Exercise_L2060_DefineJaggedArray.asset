  exerciseTitle: Define a Jagged Array
  exerciseText: Define a Jagged array of type Seat to represent theatre seating,
    make the first row have 9 seats, the second with 12 and the third one with 15
    seats.
  hintText: Jagged arrays are arrays of arrays.
  solutionText: "public Seat[][] GetSeatingDataStructure() {\r\n    // Define a jagged
    array of type Seat, make the first row with 9 seats, the second with 12 and the
    third with 15\r\n    Seat[][] seatingDataStructure = new Seat[3][];\r\n\r\n   
    seatingDataStructure[0] = new Seat[9];\r\n    seatingDataStructure[1] = new Seat[12];\r\n   
    seatingDataStructure[2] = new Seat[15];\r\n\r\n    return seatingDataStructure;\r\n}"
  completedText: Here you learned how to define a jagged array, which for some specific
    cases (like theater seating) can be the best data structure.
