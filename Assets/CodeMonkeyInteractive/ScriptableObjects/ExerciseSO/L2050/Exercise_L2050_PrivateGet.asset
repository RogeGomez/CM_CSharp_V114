  exerciseText: Define a property with a public 'get' and a private 'set'
  hintText: "The property accessors inherit the access modifier for the property
    itself. \r\nAlso remember how you cannot make the accessors less limited than
    the property itself.\r\n"
  solutionText: public string PlayerName { get; private set; }
  completedText: "Here you learned how you can define different access types for
    the property 'get' and 'set' accessors. \r\nThis is especially useful for making
    properties that any class can 'get' but only this class can 'set'.\r\nThis is
    the exact accessibility we want for the Singleton Pattern which we will cover
    later on in the course.\r\n"
