  exerciseName: LimitAccess
  exerciseTitle: Limit access
  exerciseText: Refactor this code to limit access as much as possible, you should
    make things private by default and only make them public if you need to.
  hintText: Default to making everything private, make it public only when absolutely
    needed
  solutionText: "private int speed;\r\nprivate string playerName;\r\n\r\n\r\npublic
    void SetPlayerName(string playerName) {\r\n    this.playerName = playerName;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic
    void SetSpeed(int speed) {\r\n    this.speed = speed;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void
    DoPlayerLogic() {\r\n    HandleMovement();\r\n    HandleInteractions();\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate
    void HandleMovement() {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate void HandleInteractions()
    {\r\n    // ...\r\n}"
  completedText: In this exercise you learned a very simple but very powerful guideline
    to follow, always begin by making everything private by default, and only make
    it public if you absolutely need to. This will help you minimize complexity by
    minimizing access.
