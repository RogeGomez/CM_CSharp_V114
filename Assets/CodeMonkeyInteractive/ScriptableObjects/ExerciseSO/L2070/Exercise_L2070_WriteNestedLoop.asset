  exerciseName: WriteNestedLoop
  exerciseTitle: Write a basic Nested Loop
  exerciseText: 'Write a basic nested loop where the outer loop runs 3 times and
    the inner loop runs 2 times.

    Call the ExerciseValidate(); function and pass
    in the current i and j for every iteration of the inner loop.'
  hintText: You can use any loop type, but for this case a 'for' loop is probably
    the simplest. Be careful about how many times you run the outer and inner loops.
  solutionText: "for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\r\n    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)
    {\r\n        ExerciseValidate(i, j);\r\n    }\r\n}"
  completedText: 'In this exercise you learned how to make a nested loop (a loop
    within another loop)

    This is especially useful when working with 2D arrays
    or arrays of arrays so you can cycle through every single element.'
