  exerciseTitle: Create a Dictionary
  exerciseText: 'Create a Dictionary<ResourceType, int> and set Gold to 5 and Wood
    to 12

    Call ExerciseValidate(); and pass in the dictionary.'
  hintText: 'Remember the syntax for how to define a dictionary (with key, value)
    then remember how a Dictionary is an object which needs to be constructed with
    ''new''

    And in order to set values on certain keys you access it like an
    array.'
  solutionText: 'Dictionary<ResourceType, int> dictionary = new Dictionary<ResourceType,
    int>();

    dictionary[ResourceType.Gold] = 5;

    dictionary[ResourceType.Wood]
    = 12;

    ExerciseValidate(dictionary);'
  completedText: In this exercise you learned how to create a Dictionary. This is
    one of the most useful data structures you can use, especially in games for things
    like Inventories.
