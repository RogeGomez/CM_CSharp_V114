  exerciseTitle: Create a Struct
  exerciseText: 'Define a struct named WorldPosition with int x and y fields

    Then
    define a field of that type.

    On Start() create an object of that type with
    x=1, y=2 and assign it to the field.'
  hintText: 'Remember how structs are very similar to classes, just with the ''struct''
    keyword.

    Then define a field of that type, just like a class, and construct
    it, also just like a class.'
  solutionText: "private struct WorldPosition {\r\n    public int x;\r\n    public
    int y;\r\n}\r\r\nprivate WorldPosition worldPosition;"
  completedText: Here you learned how to define a struct. This is very similar to
    a class but remember the one big difference, how structs are Value types whereas
    classes are Reference types.
