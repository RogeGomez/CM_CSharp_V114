  completedText: 'Here you learned a very important lesson on how strings are very
    brittle, one tiny change that looks almost invisible breaks everything.

    There
    is an entire lecture later on in the course on clean code guidelines and one
    of those is how you should never use strings for identifiers, this exercise shows
    why that is, it is very easy to make a mistake.
