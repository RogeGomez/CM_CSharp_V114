  exerciseTitle: Comment out function
  exerciseText: "Comment out the ExerciseSceneTester function call to make it not
    run\r"
  hintText: Remember the syntax for comments, you can complete this exercise with
    either a single line comment or a double line comment
  solutionText: '// This a comment which is treated as text and does not execute
    as code

    // ExerciseSceneTester.Instance.Error(); // This will not run'
  completedText: 'Here you learned how to write comments and one common use case
    for comments which is commenting out some code to test something.

    But remember
    that if you do this you should only do it temporarily. If you have some code
    that should never run then at some point you should clean that up. More on this
    topic in a future lecture on Clean Code guidelines.'
