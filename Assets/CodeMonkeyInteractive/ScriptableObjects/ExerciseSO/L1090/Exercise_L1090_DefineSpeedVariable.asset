  exerciseTitle: Define Speed Variable
  exerciseText: 'Edit the script Exercise.cs

    Declare a variable of type ''<b>int</b>''
    with the name ''<b>speed</b>'' and assign the value <b>5</b> to it.

    Pay
    close attention to where you write the code, Hint: Write inside the <b>Main()</b>
    function.'
  hintText: "Remember the syntax for how variables are declared. First the type,
    then the name, then optionally assign some value. \nRemember how code is case
    sensitive, define the variable named exactly '<b>speed</b>' not '<b>Speed</b>'
    or anything else."
  solutionText: 'The goal is to define a variable of type int named ''speed'' with
    the value 5, so the solution is this:

    int speed = 5;'
  completedText: In this exercise you applied what you learned about how variables
    are defined, how they have a type, a name, and a value.
