  exerciseText: Fix the error in the console, variable is being used while unassigned.
  hintText: Variables need to have some value assigned before they can be used.
  solutionText: 'The variable needs to have some value in order to be used, so just
    initialize it with something like:

    int age = 35;'
  completedText: 'Here you learned another common error, using variables before assigning
    a value to them.

    Always make sure a variable has a value, the best way to
    avoid this error is to always give it a default value when you define a variable.'
