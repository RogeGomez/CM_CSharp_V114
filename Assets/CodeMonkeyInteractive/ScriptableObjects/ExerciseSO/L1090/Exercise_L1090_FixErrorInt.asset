  exerciseName: FixErrorInt
  exerciseTitle: Fix error (Int)
  exerciseText: Edit the script Exercise.cs and fix all compile errors
  hintText: Remember how code is case sensitive.
  solutionText: There is an error that says <b>Int</b> does not exist, that is because
    code is case sensitive and the proper name for the type is <b>int</b>
  completedText: 'In this exercise you learned how to solve the most common error
    that beginners encounter, issues with capitalization.

    Always remember how
    code is case sensitive, int and Int are two completely different things, one
    exists and one does not. Same thing for float vs Float, bool vs Bool, true vs
    TRUE, etc'
