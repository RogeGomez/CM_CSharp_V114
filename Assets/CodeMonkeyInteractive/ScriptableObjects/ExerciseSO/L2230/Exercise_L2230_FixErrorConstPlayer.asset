  exerciseName: FixErrorConstPlayer
  exerciseTitle: Fix the error (Player const)
  exerciseText: Fix the error
  hintText: Remember how constants can only be used with types that are defined at
    compile time, for runtime types you need to use readonly
  solutionText: public readonly static Player DEFAULT_PLAYER = new Player();
  completedText: In this exercise you learned how to convert a const onto a static
    readonly when the type that you want to make constant is not compatible with
    const.
