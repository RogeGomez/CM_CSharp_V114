  exerciseTitle: Define a Constant and Readonly
  exerciseText: Define a constant field int PLAYER_SPEED = 5; and a static readonly
    Player DEFAULT_PLAYER = new Player();
  hintText: 'The syntax for a constant is just like a normal field, with the const
    keyword

    And the syntax for a readonly is also just like a normal field,
    with the readonly keyword.

    But remember the limitations on what types you
    can use.'
  solutionText: 'public const int PLAYER_SPEED = 5;



    public static readonly
    Player DEFAULT_PLAYER = new Player();'
  completedText: Here you learned how to define a const and readonly field. These
    are great when you have some values that are never meant to change. Use either
    const or readonly depending on the type.
