  exerciseName: DefineTesting
  exerciseTitle: Define Testing
  exerciseText: Define a TESTING preprocessor directive to make sure the code inside
    the #if is included in the compilation.
  hintText: Remember how all preprocessor directives start with #, and as long as
    a symbol is defined the #if will be included.
  solutionText: '#define TESTING'
  completedText: Here you learned how to work with preprocessor directives. These
    give you a lot of control over what the compiler does during compilation.
