  exerciseTitle: Unsubscribe
  exerciseText: Subscribe to the OnTick event, listen to it just once and then unsubscribe.
  hintText: If you subscribe to an event with += then you can unsubscribe with -=
  solutionText: "private void Start() {\r\n    // Subscribe to the OnTick even, listen
    to it just once and then unsubscribe.\r\n    OnTick += Exercise_OnTick;\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate
    void Exercise_OnTick(object sender, EventArgs e) {\r\n    OnTick -= Exercise_OnTick;\r\n}"
  completedText: Here you learned how to unsubscribe to events, this is important
    in order to not end up with dangling events where the listener has since been
    destroyed.
