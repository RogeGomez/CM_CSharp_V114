  exerciseTitle: Fix the Error
  exerciseText: Fix this error, records are immutable.
  hintText: Records are immutable by default, so in this case instead of creating
    and then modifying the record, just instantiate it with the correct data.
  solutionText: Person person = new Person("Code", "Monkey");
  completedText: 'Here you learned about record immutability, how they cannot change
    after being created (by default)

    Technically you can make them mutable but
    you shouldn''t, records are primarily meant to be used a simple data containers
    for organization.'
