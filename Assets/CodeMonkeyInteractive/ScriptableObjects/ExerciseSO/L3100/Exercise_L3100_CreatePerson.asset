  exerciseTitle: Create a Person
  exerciseText: Create a Person record with the name "Code", "Monkey", and another
    one named "Code", "Gorilla", and call the ExerciseValidate() function.
  hintText: The syntax for creating a record is similar to any constructor. Remember
    how you can also use the 'with' keyword if you want to build a new record from
    another one with some overrides.
  solutionText: 'Person person1 = new Person("Code", "Monkey");

    Person person2
    = person1 with { LastName = "Gorilla" };



    ExerciseValidate(person1, person2);'
  completedText: In this exercise you learned how to instantiate a record object
    where you can define the properties with whatever data you want.
