  exerciseName: FieldWithPublicGetSet
  exerciseTitle: Field with public Get Set
  exerciseText: Edit Exercise.cs and make a private field int speed, with public
    getter and setter functions GetSpeed(); and SetSpeed();
  hintText: Use the keywords 'private' and 'public' to define the level of access
    for each element (field, function, class) in your code.
  solutionText: "private int speed;\r\n\r\npublic int GetSpeed() {\r\n    return
    speed;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void SetSpeed(int speed) {\r\n    this.speed = speed;\r\n}"
  completedText: In this exercise you learned how to use public and private. This
    is an extremely important part of programming that becomes more and more important
    as you move onto the intermediate and advanced levels.
