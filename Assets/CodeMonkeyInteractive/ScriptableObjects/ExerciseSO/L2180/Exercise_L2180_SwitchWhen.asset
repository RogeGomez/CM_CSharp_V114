  exerciseName: SwitchWhen
  exerciseTitle: Write Switch case with when
  exerciseText: Do a switch on Unit, use the when clause to test if it's a player
    with health < 50, if so call PlayerLowHealth(); and if it's an enemy with health
    == 0 call EnemyDead();
  hintText: Write the case, then cast a type, then add some condition with 'when'
  solutionText: "switch (unit) {\r\n    case Player player when player.health < 50:\r\n       
    PlayerLowHealth();\r\n        break;\r\n    case Enemy enemy when enemy.health
    == 0:\r\n        EnemyDead();\r\n        break;\r\n}"
  completedText: In this exercise you learned how to use the 'when' keyword to apply
    conditions to your switch cases.
