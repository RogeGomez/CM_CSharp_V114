  exerciseTitle: Fix int Math
  exerciseText: 'Fix dividing these two ints to make the result a float.

    Press
    Play in Unity to test your code.'
  hintText: 'If you divide an int by another int the result will be an int.

    If
    you want a float result then at least one of the elements involved in the calculation
    need to be a float'
  solutionText: 'Cast one of the elements onto a float to ensure the final result
    is a float.

    float healthNormalized = (float)healthAmount / healthAmountMax;'
  completedText: 'Here you learned to solve one very common problem, if you divide
    two ints you will get an int result which might not be what you want.

    I''ve
    encountered this error myself many times, so always remember what types you are
    doing math with.'
