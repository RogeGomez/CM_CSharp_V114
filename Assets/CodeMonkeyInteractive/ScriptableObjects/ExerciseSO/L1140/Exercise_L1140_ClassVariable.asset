  exerciseName: ClassVariable
  exerciseTitle: Class Variable
  exerciseText: 'Define a class variable to fix the error where 2 functions are trying
    to access it.

    There''s a detailed lecture on Classes later on in the course.

'
  hintText: Class variables are defined within the class code block { } but outside
    any function code block.
  solutionText: "private int age;\r\n\r\nprivate void Test() {\r\n    age++;\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate
    void PrintAge() {\r\n    Debug.Log(age);\r\n}"
  completedText: In this exercise you learned another method for solving scope issues,
    if you want multiple functions to access one variable, either pass them in as
    function parameters or make it a class variable which will be accessible by any
    function.
