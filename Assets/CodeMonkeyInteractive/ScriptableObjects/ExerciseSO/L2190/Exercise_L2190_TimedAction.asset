  exerciseTitle: Implement an Action Timer
  exerciseText: Implement a timer function, on TickTimer(); it should do tick--;
    and if tick <= 0 it should trigger the Action.
  hintText: Store the action as a member variable, then call it when tick is under
    0.
  solutionText: "private void SetAction(Action action) {\r\n    this.action = action;\r\n}"
  completedText: Here you learned to implement a simple timer logic where it is very
    adaptable thanks to receiving an Action as a parameter which can then run any
    code the calling function wants.
