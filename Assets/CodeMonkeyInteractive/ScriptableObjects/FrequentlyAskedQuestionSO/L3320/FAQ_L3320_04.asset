  title: What are unit tests and how do they differ from assertions?
  text: Unit tests are tests written to check the functionality of a specific section
    of code (a "unit"), such as a function or a class, to ensure it behaves as expected.
    Tests create certain scenarios and verify that each part of the system works
    as intended.
