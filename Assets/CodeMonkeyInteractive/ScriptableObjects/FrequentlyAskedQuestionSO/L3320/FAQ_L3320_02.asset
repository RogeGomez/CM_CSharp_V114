  title: When should you use Debug.Assert versus Trace.Assert?
  text: 'Debug.Assert is used for assertions that you only want to execute in a Debug
    build of your application; they are ignored in release builds.

    This is
    useful for checks that should not impact the performance or behavior of a production
    application.

    Trace.Assert, on the other hand, works in both debug and release
    builds, making it suitable for assertions you want to enforce regardless of the
    build configuration.'
