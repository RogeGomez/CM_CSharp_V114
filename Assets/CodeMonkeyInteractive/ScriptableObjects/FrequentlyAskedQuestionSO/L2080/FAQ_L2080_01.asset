  title: What is recursion, and how does it work in C#?
  text: "Recursion is another way of doing looping logic without using loops. And
    how it works is simply the act of a function that calls itself.\n##REF##code,\r\nprivate
    void TestRecursiveFunction() {\r\n    TestRecursiveFunction();\r\n}\r\n##REF##\nThis
    is a super simple example of recursion, and also an example of an infinite loop
    which you can accidentally create with recursion just like you can with regular
    loops.\r\nSo normally the recursive function will have some kind of parameter
    that eventually breaks the cycle.\r\n"
