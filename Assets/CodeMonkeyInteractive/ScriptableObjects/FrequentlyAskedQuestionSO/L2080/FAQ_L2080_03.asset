  title: What is stack overflow, and why does it occur in the context of recursion?
  text: 'When you call a function, the CPU stores the function memory address in
    the function call stack. If you call a function too many times, like infinite
    recursion, then at some point that call stack runs out of memory and overflows.

    Since
    regular loops don''t call functions they don''t have that problem, they simply
    run forever.
