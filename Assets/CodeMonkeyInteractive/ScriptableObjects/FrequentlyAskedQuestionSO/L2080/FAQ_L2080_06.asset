  title: Can I use recursion instead of loops if I prefer it?
  text: 'Absolutely!

    For some people, espeically those with a math background,
    they might find recursion more intuitive than using loops. If that''s you then
    yup feel free to only use recursion.

    Anything you can do with a loop you
    can do with recursion so use the tool that you prefer.
