  title: What does the 'var' keyword do, and when should I use it?
  text: 'The var keyword lets the compiler infer the type of a variable based on
    what value you assign to it.

    ##REF##code,

    var i = 35; // int

    var
    name = "Code Monkey"; // string

    var isEnemy = false; // bool

    ##REF##

    Some
    people like how compact it is, but personally I am not a fan of var because it
    obscures what type is actually being used. I like my code to be as explicit as
    possible so I never have to question what types I''m working with.
