  title: What are data types, and why are they important in programming?
  text: 'All data in programming has some kind of type, like a number or a string
    of text.

    Data Types are how you define what type of data you are working
    with.

    For example if you define a variable of type string then the compiler
    knows that variable can only contain strings of text

    If you define a variable
    of type int then the compiler only lets you store whole numbers inside it. If
    you try storing a string of text or a decimal number you get an error.
