  title: What is the difference between double, float, and decimal in C#?
  text: 'All 3 store values with decimal points, like 56.4

    But they have different
    sizes in bytes which affect the min/max values they can store as well as their
    precision.

    Check out the official C# docs for the details: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/floating-point-numeric-types</a>

    Also
    they have different postfixes.

    To define a float you need to append <b>f</b>

    To
    define a decimal you need to append <b>m</b>

    To define a double you don''t
    append anything.
