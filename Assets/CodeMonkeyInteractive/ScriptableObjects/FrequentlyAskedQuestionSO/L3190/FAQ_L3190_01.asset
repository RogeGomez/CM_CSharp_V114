  title: What is a preprocessor directive in C#?
  text: 'Preprocessor directives are instructions that are processed by the compiler
    before the actual compilation of code begins.

    They start with a # symbol
    and are not part of the C# language itself but are used to give special instructions
    to the compiler.'
