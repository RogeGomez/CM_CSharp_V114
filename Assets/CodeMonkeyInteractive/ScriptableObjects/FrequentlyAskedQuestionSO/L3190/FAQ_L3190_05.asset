  title: What is the difference between #if and a regular if statement?
  text: 'The #if directive is a preprocessor directive that evaluates at compile
    time, meaning it includes or excludes code before the program is compiled.

    Whereas
    a regular if statement is evaluated at runtime and is part of the executable
    code.'
