  title: How do you use conditional compilation with #if?
  text: "You can use the #if directive to include or exclude parts of the code during
    compilation based on whether a symbol is defined. \r\nFor example:\r\n#define
    DEBUG\r\n\r\n#if DEBUG\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Debug mode is on.\");\r\n#endif\r\n\r\nThis
    code will only execute the Console.WriteLine method if the DEBUG symbol is defined.\r\nIf
    we remove the define then that code is not included in the compilation at all."
