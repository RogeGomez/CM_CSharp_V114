  title: What does #pragma warning disable do?
  text: 'The #pragma warning disable directive is used to suppress compiler warnings.
    You can disable all warnings or a specific one.

    This can be useful for
    eliminating warnings about code that you know is correct but that the compiler
    flags as potentially problematic.'
