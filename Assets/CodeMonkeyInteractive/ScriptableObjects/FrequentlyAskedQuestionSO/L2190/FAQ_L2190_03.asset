  title: Do you have to define custom delegates?
  text: 'C# has two built-in super useful delegates, Action and Func. They have various
    versions that work with generics which allows you to use them in pretty much
    any scenario.

    However custom delegates also have their place, they have
    one huge benefit which is how you can define a proper name for them.

    Sometimes
    it might make the code more readable to have

    ##REF##code,

    TakeDamageDelegate
    takeDamage;

    ##REF##

    Instead of:

    ##REF##code,

    Action<int>
    takeDamage;

    ##REF##'
