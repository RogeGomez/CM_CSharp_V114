  title: What are some common use cases for delegates?
  text: 'Common usecases are for any kind of asynchronous programming, so anything
    where it will take some time to get a result but you don''t want to block the
    execution of the program, like contacting a webserver.

    Usually you will
    contact the webserver and use a delegate for the callback that will be triggered
    whenever the server responds, without blocking the main program while waiting.

    Or
    for something like Pathfinding where usually the algorithm is made to work in
    a multithreaded manner and won''t immediately execute. You can add a callback
    that will run later on when the path is calculated.
