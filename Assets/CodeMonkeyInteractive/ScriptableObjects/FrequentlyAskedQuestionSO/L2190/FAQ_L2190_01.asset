  title: What is a delegate in C#?
  text: 'A delegate is how you can reference a function in a type. So you can have
    a delegate that has a signature where it returns void and takes in no parameters,
    and then have some field of that type, and then some function "void MyFunction()"
    assigned to that field.

    Then you can "run" that field which in turn will
    run the function that it is referencing.
