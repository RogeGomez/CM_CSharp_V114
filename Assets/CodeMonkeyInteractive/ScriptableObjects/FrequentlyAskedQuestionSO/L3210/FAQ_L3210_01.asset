  title: What is boxing in C#?
  text: 'Boxing in C# is the process of converting a type into an object type. Since
    object is the base C# type all types can be converted onto it.

    In doing
    that to value types like int, the int is placed inside a "box" which is a reference
    type of type object.

    Then unboxing is the process of getting the data back
    out by casting it to the original type.'
