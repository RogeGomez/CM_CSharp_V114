  title: Can unboxing cause errors?
  text: 'Yes, if you attempt to unbox an object to a different type than the one
    it was originally boxed from, it will throw an InvalidCastException. Always ensure
    the type you are unboxing to matches the original boxed type.

    You can use
    an ''is'' check.'
