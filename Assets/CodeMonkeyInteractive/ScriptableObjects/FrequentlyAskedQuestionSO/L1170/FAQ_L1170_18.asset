  title: What are some common mistakes that lead to infinite loops?
  text: 'The main one is simply some mistake in the condition, usually mistaking
    < instead of > or similar.

    Alternatively forgetting to use some kind of
    iterator variable in a while or do while

    Or doing i--; instead of i++;

    Always
    pay very close attention to your condition and your iterator variable.

    Or
    simply prefer to use the foreach whenever possible since that one never has an
    infinite loop.
