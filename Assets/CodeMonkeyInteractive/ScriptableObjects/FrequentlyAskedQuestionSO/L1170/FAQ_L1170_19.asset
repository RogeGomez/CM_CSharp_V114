  title: How do I write some safety code to prevent infinite loops?
  text: "This code tries to find a target for the player, but if that never succeeds
    you would end up with an infinite loop.\r\nSo you can define a safety variable
    that will make sure the code only runs at most 100 times and guarantees you never
    have an infinite loop.\n##REF##code,\r\nint safety = 0;\r\nwhile (!PlayerHasTarget()
    && safety < 100) {\r\n    PlayerFindTarget();\r\n    safety++;\r\n}\r\n##REF##"
