  title: Should I use a for or a foreach to cycle through a list or array? Cannot
    modify while looping
  text: "You should probably prefer a foreach over a for since it is much simpler
    to implement.\r\nHowever one thing you cannot do in a foreach is modify the collection
    that you are cycling through.\r\nThis code will throw an error:\n##REF##code,\r\nforeach
    (string name in nameList) {\r\n    nameList.Remove(name); // Cannot modify collection
    while cycling through it!\r\n}\n##REF##\r\nSo if you need to do this kind of
    thing use a for instead\r\n"
