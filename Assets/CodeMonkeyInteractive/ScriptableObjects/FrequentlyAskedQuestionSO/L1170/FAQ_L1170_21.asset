  title: Can a loop be used inside another loop? What is a nested loop?
  text: 'Yup! You can have loops inside other loops, these are nested loops.

    There
    is a dedicated lecture on Nested Loops later on in the Intermediate section.

    As
    always keep in mind your main goal of writing clean readable code. The more nested
    loops you have the harder it is to understand what the code is doing, so use
    them sparingly.
