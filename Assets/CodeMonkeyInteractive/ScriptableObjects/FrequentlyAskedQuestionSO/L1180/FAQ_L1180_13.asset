  title: What is the difference between class variables (fields) and local variables?
  text: 'The difference is scope.

    Local variables have a scope of the code
    block where they are defined, so if defined within a function they are only accessible
    within that function.

    Class variables also have the scope of the code block
    where they are defined, but in this case the code block is the class code block
    meaning class variables are accessible from any code within that class like any
    function.
