  title: Can classes contain methods (functions)?
  text: 'Yup! You can define functions inside a class just like we learned previously.

    To
    access that function you simply need to through the object of that class type.

    For
    example if you have a Player class that has a function name Attack(); and you
    created an instance of that player you call it with this

    player.Attack();

    Note
    how we''re calling the function through the instanced object and not the class
    name itself. This is important because in this scenario the Attack(); function
    is not marked as static.
