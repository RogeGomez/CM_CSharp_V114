  title: What is the difference between a variable and a field?
  text: 'Those two terms are mostly interchangeable.

    Technically a variable
    is something like a local variable defined inside a function.

    And technically
    if you define a class variable the correct term for it is field.

    However
    most people will understand what you mean if you use either term.
