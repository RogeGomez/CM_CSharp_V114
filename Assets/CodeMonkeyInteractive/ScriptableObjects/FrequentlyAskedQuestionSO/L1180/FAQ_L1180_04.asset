  title: What is an instance of a class?
  text: 'That is when you create an object of that class.

    The class is basically
    a blueprint, and you can create objects or instances of that class using that
    blueprint.

    It''s important to keep in mind that objects created from the
    same class are independent. They come from the same blueprint but they are completely
    separate objects.

    In this code Player1 and Player2 are two completely separate
    objects, they have the same data structure but each has their own data in memory.

    ##REF##code,

    Player
    player1 = new Player();

    Player player2 = new Player();

    ##REF##'
