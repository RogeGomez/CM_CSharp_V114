  title: Is it necessary to use curly braces {} in if statements?
  text: "Technically no, if you have an if and inside that if you only want to do
    a single instruction you can omit the curly braces.\n##REF##code,\nif (true)
    \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Something\"); // Runs only when the if is true\n##REF##\nHowever
    if you do that, it is very easy to make the mistake of forgetting to add curly
    braces if you suddenly want to add more than one instruction\n##REF##code,\nif
    (true) \n    Console.WriteLine(\"Something\"); // Runs only when the if is true\n   
    Console.WriteLine(\"Another\"); // This one runs every time\n##REF##\nIn this
    case the second instruction runs every time, regardless of the if result, it
    is completely outside of the if even though visually the identation looks like
    it's inside, but like I covered previously, remember how for the compiler the
    identation does not exist, it does not matter, all that matters are code blocks.\nSo
    technically you don't have to always include curly braces, but I highly recommend
    you do to avoid these kinds of mistakes. Believe me I've made these mistakes
    many times and caused me a ton of headaches before I decided to always use curly
    braces.\n"
