  title: What is the conditional short circuit?
  text: "This is how the evaluation of if conditions will only happen if they are
    needed.\nFor example, if you have two conditions with an OR between them (which
    means the result is true if either element is true) and the first one evaluates
    to true (code executes left to right) it does not matter what the second one
    evaluates to because whether it's true or false the result when combined with
    a 'true OR' will always be true\n##REF##code,\nif (true || ReallyExpensiveFunction())
    {\n  // This code runs, ReallyExpensiveFunction() is never called\n}\n##REF##\nAlternatively
    if you're doing an AND operation (which means the result will be true only if
    both are true) and the first one evaluates to false, then it won't evaluate the
    second condition because regardless of the result when combined with a false
    && it will end up false\n##REF##code,\nif (false && ReallyExpensiveFunction())
    {\n  // This code does not run, and ReallyExpensiveFunction() is never called\n}\n##REF##"
