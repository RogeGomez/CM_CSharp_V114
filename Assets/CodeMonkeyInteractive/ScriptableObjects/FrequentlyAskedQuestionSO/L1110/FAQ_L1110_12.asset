  title: What does it mean to chain else if statements, and how does it work?
  text: "You can write an if then an else and inside that else write another if,
    and on and on.\n##REF##code,\nif (a == 3) {\n\t// Something\n} else if (a < 3)
    {\n\t// Something\n} else if (a > 3) {\n\t// Something\n}\n##REF##\nHowever again
    this can potentially negatively impact code readability if you have a super long
    chain, so always ask yourself if this really is the best way to achieve what
    you're trying to do? Or perhaps you could place this testing logic in a Switch
    or a Function.\n"
