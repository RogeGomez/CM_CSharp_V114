  title: What if I write & instead of &&?
  text: 'The single ampersand & is the bitwise AND operator, this is a more advanced
    operator for working with bits. I cover this later on in the Advanced section
    of this course.

    The double ampersand && is the logical AND operator which
    is how you combine two conditions in a logical AND
