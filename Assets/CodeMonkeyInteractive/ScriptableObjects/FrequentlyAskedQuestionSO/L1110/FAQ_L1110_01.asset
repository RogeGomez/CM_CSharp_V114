  title: What is an if statement and how does it work in C#?
  text: 'Ifs are core to any kind of programming, it''s how you can use a condition
    and depending on whether it''s true or false the code execution branches and
    it runs some code or some other code.

    They are quite simple to write, if
    and then a condition with an optional else, but despite their simplicity they
    are core to making pretty much any program.
