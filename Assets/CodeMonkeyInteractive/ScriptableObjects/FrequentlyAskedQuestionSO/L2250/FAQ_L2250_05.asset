  title: In Unity, how do coroutines work with IEnumerator?
  text: 'Coroutines in Unity are how you can run some logic over multiple frames
    or do some timing logic.

    You write a function that returns IEnumerator which
    inside it has whatever logic you want, including some built-in Unity functions
    like yield return WaitForSeconds(x); which will wait x number of seconds before
    resuming execution.

    And then you can start executing the coroutine by writing
    StartCoroutine(MyFunction()); in a MonoBehaviour.
