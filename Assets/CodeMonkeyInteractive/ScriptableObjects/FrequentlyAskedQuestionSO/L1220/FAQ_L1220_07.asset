  title: What is the single responsibility principle?
  text: 'This principle says that code should do one thing and one thing only. This
    can be applicable to an individual function or an entire class.

    For example
    your Player class should only be responsible for handling the Player object,
    it should not be responsible for handling Saving and Loading to a file. It should
    not be responsible for handling the Main Menu UI

    If you have a function
    AttackEnemy(); then it should only attack the enemy, it shouldn''t load the next
    Level or start some Boss fight.
