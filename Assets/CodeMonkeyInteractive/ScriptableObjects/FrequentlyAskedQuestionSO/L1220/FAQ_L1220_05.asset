  title: What are 'magic numbers', and why should they be avoided?
  text: 'Magic numbers are numbers that show up in the code that make it really tricky
    to understand what exactly it represents.

    For example in this code, what
    does 5 mean?

    ##REF##code,

    if (Distance(playerPosition, enemyPosition)
    < 5) { }

    ##REF##

    It''s hard to tell just by looking at it, you need
    to read a bunch more code to understand what it represents.

    Whereas on this
    code:

    ##REF##code,

    int attackDistance = 5;

    if (Distance(playerPosition,
    enemyPosition) < attackDistance) { }

    ##REF##

    Now it''s absolutely clear
    as to what the number represents.

    So by using a properly named local variable
    we made our code much more easy to understand instead of using a magic number.
