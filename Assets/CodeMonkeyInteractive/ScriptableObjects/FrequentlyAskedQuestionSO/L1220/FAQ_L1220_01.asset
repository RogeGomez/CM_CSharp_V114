  title: What is clean code, and why is it important in programming?
  text: 'There''s a bunch of definitions of clean code, my definition is that clean
    code is simply code that is easy to understand, easy to read, and easy to modify.

    It
    is very important because the more you focus on writing good clean code the easier
    it will be to work in your codebase.

    Sometimes beginners don''t value this
    because they make super tiny projects that are just a handful of lines. And with
    such simple projects writing code properly or terribly doesn''t do that much
    of a difference.

    But as you start working on more complex projects with
    many more classes and many more interconnected systems, if you write dirty code
    then at some point you will be completely overwhelmed by all that unnecessary
    complexity and will likely give up at some point.

    Whereas if you always
    focus on writing good clean code then even on larger projects it is still manageable
    and easy to work it.
