  title: My code works, why should I care if my code is clean or dirty?
  text: 'Because the dirtier your code the harder it is to work with.

    For super
    simple things "just works" might be enough, but as your projects grow in complexity
    then "just works" isn''t enough. If something "just works" but it takes you one
    hour to read the code to understand HOW it''s working then that is a hugely wasteful
    time sink.

    If you''re making some throwaway code then sure "just works"
    will work, but if it''s some code that you want to be actually useful in the
    future then make it work properly.
