  title: What role do comments play in clean code? Should I use them?
  text: 'Comments are definitely a valuable tool, however they should only be used
    AFTER writing some proper clean code.

    Ideally your code should be self-documenting,
    if someone reads just the code they should be able to understand what the code
    is doing.

    But sometimes even when using proper names for everything, sometimes
    some part of the code might require some plain text explanation, and in those
    cases yup writing a comment is fine.

    Just make sure you only write a comment
    when there''s no way to write what you want to say in the code itself, which
    in most cases you can indeed make the code intent clear in the code itself just
    by using good names.
