  title: Why is it important to avoid using public access modifiers unnecessarily?
  text: 'In order to minimize complexity by minimizing access.

    The more you
    minimize how much each member can be accessed, the easier it is to debug when
    something goes wrong.

    If something is private and has some bug, you know
    for certain that bug has to exist within that class, it cannot exist elsewhere
    in your code base since nothing else can access it, no matter whether the code
    base has 10 classes or 1000 classes.

    So you should always default to making
    everything private, and only make it public when you absolutely need to.
