  title: Should I follow these clean code rules religiously?
  text: '<b>NO!</b>

    These are just guidelines, it is up to you as the programmer
    to know when to apply these rules and when to break them.

    Always remember
    the main goal behind all of these rules and guidelines, the main purpose is to
    help you write code that is easier to understand and easier to work with which
    will make your life easier as you continue working in that code base.

    For
    example, the Dont Repeat Yourself rule tells you to not have copy pasted code,
    however sometimes having a tiny bit of copy pasted code might be better than
    extracting into a function.

    Or the Single Responsibility Principle, sometimes
    it might make sense for example for your Player to maybe fire some sound effects
    in a simple game instead of building an entire Sound Manager.

    The goal of
    these rules is to help you, and it''s up to you to analyze your project and your
    own code to figure out whether following the rules or breaking them will allow
    you to achieve that goal.

    So in general you should follow them because in
    general they will help you, but you should also be aware that it''s perfectly
    okay to break them when needed.
