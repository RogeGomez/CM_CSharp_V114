  title: What is WinForms used for in C# development?
  text: 'WinForms, short for Windows Forms, is used for building graphical user interfaces
    (GUIs) in C# applications.

    It provides a library of controls such as buttons,
    text boxes, labels, and many others that can be dragged onto a form to build
    a user interface.

    The backend code is all the same, it''s all C#, but instead
    of running it based on text input or command line arguments you can have visual
    buttons.'
