  title: How can I ensure that my WinForms application is responsive and does not
    freeze during long operations?
  text: 'To keep a WinForms application responsive, perform long-running operations
    on a background thread rather than the UI thread. You can use background workers,
    tasks, or async and await to handle these operations asynchronously and update
    the UI thread when necessary without freezing it.
