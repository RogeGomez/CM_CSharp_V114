  title: How do you handle events in WinForms?
  text: Events in WinForms are handled using event handlers. You can subscribe to
    events provided by controls, such as the Click event of a button, and then implement
    an event handler method that defines the actions to be taken when the event is
    fired. (when the button is clicked)
