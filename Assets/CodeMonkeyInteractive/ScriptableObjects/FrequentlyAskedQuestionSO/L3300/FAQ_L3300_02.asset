  title: How does WinForms differ from WPF?
  text: 'WinForms is simpler and more straightforward for designing standard desktop
    applications. It uses a less complex rendering system and has been around longer
    than WPF. WPF, or Windows Presentation Foundation, provides more flexibility
    and features for creating more complex user interfaces including complex 3D visuals.

    For
    simple things use WinForms (or just a Console app), for more visually complex
    programs, personally I like simply using Unity but you can use WPF.'
