  title: How do I know if my code needs refactoring?
  text: 'Any situation in which you see that the code could be written in a better
    way.

    Maybe you have some duplicated code, maybe super huge functions or
    classes, maybe confusing names.

    Perhaps you first wrote some logic and
    just used random non-sensical names, if so take some time to refactor that code
    with proper names. Use the Ctrl + R + R shortcut to easily rename every instance
    of that symbol.

    Perhaps initially your game only needed one Player but
    later on you realize you want more players. Go back to that code and refactor
    all the places where you made the assumption that there would only be a single
    player in your entire game.

    The specific type of refactoring that is required
    differs on a case by case basis so there are no hard rules. Just remember that
    code is a living thing and you are meant to constantly be analyzing all your
    code and thinking if there is some way you could achieve the same result better.
    If so then take some time to refactor that code.
