  title: How often should I refactor my code? Is there such a thing as too much refactoring?
  text: 'Always and no. You should always be analyzing your code and if you ever
    come up with a better way of doing things then you should take the time to refactor
    your code.

    Obviously don''t get stuck over-optimizing some piece of code,
    your code should be high quality but does not need to be perfect, use common
    sense but in general yes you should always be thinking about potential ways to
    improve your codebase.
