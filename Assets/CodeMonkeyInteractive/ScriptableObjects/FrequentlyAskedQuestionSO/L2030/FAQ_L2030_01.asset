  title: What is refactoring, and why is it important in programming?
  text: 'Refactoring is the act of rewriting some code to be more organized and easier
    to read.

    Usually this involves changing names of functions/fields, placing
    certain logic in it''s own class or just extracting some common logic into a
    separate function.

    It''s extremely important because it helps you keep
    your code as high quality as possible even as your project grows.

    If you''re
    working in your codebase and you see an opportunity to improve some code, take
    some time to do exactly that. If you do then even as your project grows more
    and more in complexity it will still be easy to work with.
