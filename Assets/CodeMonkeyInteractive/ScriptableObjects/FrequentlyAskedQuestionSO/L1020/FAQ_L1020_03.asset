  title: 'What does cross-platform mean? '
  text: 'It means your code can run on multiple platforms. Normally you have to compile
    your code to a certain instruction set, meaning the program is only compiled
    to run on Windows, that same code will not run on Linux or Mac. You need slightly
    different code to run on those different platforms.

    Whereas C# supports
    multi-platform, meaning you can make a project and write all your code while
    working in Windows, and then that same code can run on Linux, Mac, Xbox, Android,
    etc.

    For example, my games that I build with Unity, they are playable on
    Windows, Mac and Linux. I don''t have to build 3 separate projects, just select
    a different build target and the exact same code will work.
