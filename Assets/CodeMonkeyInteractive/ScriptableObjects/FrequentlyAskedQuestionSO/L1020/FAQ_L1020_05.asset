  title: What does 'type safe' mean in programming?
  text: 'It means the compiler enforces certain rules that mean your code will only
    compile if it follows those rules.

    For example if you do:

    ##REF##code,
    int a = 5;

    string b = a; // Error!##REF##

    You get a compile error because
    you cannot automatically convert an ''int'' type onto a ''string'' type.

    This
    is great because it forces you to write proper code which helps you before compilation
    which leads to fewer errors during runtime.

    Whereas other non type safe
    languages, like Javascript, you can have that kind of code, and then perhaps
    it will work in runtime or it will throw an error.

    Type safe forces you
    to use the correct types which greatly reduces the odds of a runtime error.
