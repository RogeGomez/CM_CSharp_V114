  title: What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
  text: 'There are two main programming paradigms, Object-Oriented Programming and
    Functional Programming.

    Functional Programming is all about having individual
    functions that do all the work. All the logic, all the state, is based on the
    input and output of all the functions.

    Whereas Object-Oriented Programming
    is all based on objects and those objects can have state (like variables) and
    logic (like functions)
