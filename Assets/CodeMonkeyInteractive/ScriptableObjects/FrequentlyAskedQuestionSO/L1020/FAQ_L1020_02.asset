  title: What is the difference between C#, Java, and C++?
  text: "They can all do object-oriented programming so in that sense they are actually
    quite similar. \r\nIf you know one you will quickly pick up the other ones. There
    are various syntax differences, but in general they all have objects, they all
    have functions, they all have variables, etc.\r\n"
