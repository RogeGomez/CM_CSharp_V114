  title: What does "type does not exist" mean, and how can I fix it?
  text: 'This error usually means you''re trying to use a class or type that hasn''t
    been defined or imported.

    First check for typos to make sure you write
    the class name perfectly exact.

    Then ensure you''ve included the correct
    using statements for namespaces where that class exists.

    For example if
    you try to define a variable of type List<int> you will get an error if you don''t
    include using System.Collections.Generic;

    Also when working with the top-level
    statements template, it automatically includes some common using statements.
