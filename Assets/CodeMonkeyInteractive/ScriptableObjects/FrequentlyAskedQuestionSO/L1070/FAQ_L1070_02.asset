  title: Why is code case-sensitive, and how does it affect my program?
  text: 'C# is a case-sensitive language, meaning it distinguishes between uppercase
    and lowercase letters.

    int and Int are two completely different things as
    far as the compiler is concerned. ''int'' is a built-in type, whereas ''Int''
    does not exist (unless you define it)

    If a function is called MyFunction();
    and you write myFunction(); you get an error because it does not perfectly match.

    The
    compiler does not know English, it only knows exact symbols, and a lower case
    and upper case letter are two completely different things.

    So always pay
    very very close attention to how you write your code, changing the capitalization
    even on just one tiny letter means you are suddenly referencing something completely
    different.
