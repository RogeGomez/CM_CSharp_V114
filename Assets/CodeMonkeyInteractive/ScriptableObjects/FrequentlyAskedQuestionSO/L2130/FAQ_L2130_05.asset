  title: Can value types be null?
  text: 'No, value types always have to have a value, so you cannot do int i = null;

    However
    there is a special type called Nullables which can make any type able to support
    null, so this is valid code:

    ##REF##code,

    int? i = null;

    ##REF##

    I
    cover Nullables in detail in a lecture in the Advanced section.
