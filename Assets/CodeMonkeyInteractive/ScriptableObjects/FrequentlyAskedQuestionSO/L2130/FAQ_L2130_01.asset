  title: What are the main differences between value types and reference types in
    C#?
  text: 'The main difference is how value types store the data directly whereas reference
    types store a pointer to the location in memory that actually contains the data.

    So
    when working with value types, if you call a function with a value type parameter
    that function will receive a copy of that data.

    Whereas with a reference
    type, the function will receive the same pointer that points to the same data
    in memory, not a copy.
