  title: What are some examples of value types and reference types?
  text: 'The built-in types, like int, bool, float, are value types. If you pass
    them into a function they are passed in as a copy, if you modify that copy inside
    the function it does not affect the original data.

    Classes are reference
    types, so if you pass in a Player class object to a function you are passing
    in a reference to the original object. Changes made to that player object inside
    the function modify the actual object outside the function.
