  title: What is a struct, and how does it differ from a class in terms of being
    a value type or reference type?
  text: 'Structs are similar to classes in that they can store data in fields and
    have functions, however they are value types.

    So when you use them remember
    whether you''re working with the original data or a copy.

    Whereas classes
    are reference types so they work as references and not copies.
