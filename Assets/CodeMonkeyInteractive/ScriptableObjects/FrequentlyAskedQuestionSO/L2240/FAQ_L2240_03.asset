  title: Can you handle multiple specific types of exceptions with multiple catch
    blocks?
  text: 'Yup!

    You can define multiple catch blocks each capturing a different
    exception.

    Just make sure you go top down from most specific to least specific,
    since all exceptions extend System.Exception you can put that type at the very
    end after the more specific exceptions.
