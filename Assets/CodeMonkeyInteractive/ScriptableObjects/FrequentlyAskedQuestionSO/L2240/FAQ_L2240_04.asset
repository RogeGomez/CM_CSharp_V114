  title: What is the main purpose of the finally block?
  text: 'Usually the main purpose is to do any sort of clean up.

    Like for example
    if in the try block you open some file for reading or writing, you want to make
    sure to close that file regardless of whether an exception happens or not, otherwise
    you end up with memory/access leaks.
