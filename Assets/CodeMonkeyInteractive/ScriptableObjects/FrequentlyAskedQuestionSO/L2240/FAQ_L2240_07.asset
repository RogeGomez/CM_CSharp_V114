  title: What does it mean to rethrow exceptions? And how is it done?
  text: 'It means that you caught the exception in a catch block but do not know
    how the exception should be handled. If so you can rethrow the exact same exception
    by just writing:

    throw;

    Doing this will throw the exact same exception
    upwards on the function call stack.
