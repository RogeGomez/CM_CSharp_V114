  title: What limitations do expression-bodied members have?
  text: 'Expression-bodied members must consist of a single expression and cannot
    contain multiple statements or a block of code.

    This means they are typically
    used for very simple operations, like returning a value or assigning a value,
    but not for more complex logic.

    This limitation is a very good thing because
    it means you can only use them where it makes sense, you can''t abuse them in
    scenarios where it would result in worse readability.'
