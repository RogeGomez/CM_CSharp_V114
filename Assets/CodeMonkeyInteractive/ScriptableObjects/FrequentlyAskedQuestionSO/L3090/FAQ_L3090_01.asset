  title: What are expression-bodied members?
  text: 'Expression-bodied members allow you to write the body of certain members
    (like functions or properties) using a concise lambda expression syntax.

    This
    makes the code very compact and possibly more readable, but only when the member
    implementation is simple, like simple Get/Set functions/properties.'
