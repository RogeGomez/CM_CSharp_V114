  title: How do I design a project like this?
  text: "In terms of project management/design there is no single universal correct
    way to do it, everyone has their own process.\r\nSome people like making super
    detailed Game Design Documents, others like making complex UML diagrams, some
    people just like a rough sketch. All of those options are valid.\r\nPersonally
    I tend to just do a bit of a high level overview on paper. I write down the core
    elements I want to implement and how they might interact with one another, nothing
    super detailed, just a very high level overview. And then I quickly make a simple
    tiny prototype. \r\nThat's my personal process but like I said everyone works
    differently, so experiment with various project planning methods and find out
    what works for you.\r\n"
