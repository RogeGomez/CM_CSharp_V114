  title: What is [SerializeField]?
  text: 'This is an attribute that is used, specifically in Unity, to make a private
    field show up in the editor. Without it the private field does not appear in
    the inspector.

    What beginners tend to do is make the field public which
    will make it show up in the editor, but like I covered in the lecture on Clean
    Code Guidelines, this is a terrible practice because it enables read/write access
    to that field from any class in your entire codebase. So the workaround is to
    make it private and add the [SerializeField] attribute.

    I made an entire
    video on why you should not make everything public, and in there I talk about
    this workaround.
