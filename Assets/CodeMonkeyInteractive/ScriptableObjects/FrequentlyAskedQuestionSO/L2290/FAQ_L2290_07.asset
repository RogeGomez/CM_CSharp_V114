  title: How could I add another weapon?
  text: "You would make another class that extends Weapon, give it a new enum value
    ItemType, a new sprite and define the UseItem(); logic for that weapon.\r\nThen
    make another weapon Object script that implements IGrabObject and returns an
    instance of the logic class. Build a visual prefab and attach the object script
    onto it.\r\nAnd yup that's it! \r\nThen you should be able to pick up the weapon,
    select it in the inventory and upon using it it should run the custom logic that
    you defined.\r\n"
