  title: Could some parts of this project be made differently?
  text: 'Yup!

    The structure for this project is just one of many many possible
    ways to do it. You could have a dedicated class to handle the Money, you could
    have a separate class to handle the shooting, you could have avoided using inheritance
    for the weapons, you could have used direct references instead of the GameAssets
    singleton, you could have used Scriptable Objects for the item types instead
    of an enum, etc.

    Whenever you picture a game in your head, keep in mind
    there are many many ways to reach that goal, and as long as you reach that goal
    then all those methods are valid.
