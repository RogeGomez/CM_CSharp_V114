  title: Should I take some time to inspect and modify the project?
  text: 'YES!

    As I''ve said many times, you learn by doing, so take some time
    to modify some things in this project. Inspect the code in your own time to see
    how it all works, how it all connects, how all the classes relate to one another.

    Then
    change something, change the player speed to see what it does, try making another
    weapon or enemy type.

    A complete working project like this one is great
    for taking it apart to see how it all works.
