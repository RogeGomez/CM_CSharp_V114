  title: How long does a project like this take to build?
  text: 'It really depends on your own skillset. For someone who is a complete beginner
    to any kind of programming, I expect them to take several months until they reach
    this lecture.

    Maybe a bit faster if you already know some programming and
    just need to learn the specifics for how Unity works.

    And in my case, where
    I already have all the knowledge covered in this course and I''m already very
    experienced with Unity and Game Dev in general, for me it took me maybe 6-8 hours
    to build this demo.

    Experience is a very important thing, this is not the
    first (or 10th) top down shooter game I''ve made, it''s not the first time I''ve
    written a HealthSystem or used Interfaces to handle combat. Once you have the
    knowledge and have a clear design in your head of what you are trying to build,
    then everything gets done pretty quickly.
