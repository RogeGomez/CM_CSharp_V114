  title: Are there performance differences between using local functions and lambdas?
  text: 'Local functions are more performant mainly due to the fact that normally
    they are only defined once, in the background the compiler creates a normal function
    base on the local function, whereas Lambdas are actual objects that are created
    whenever that function runs.

    However if you capture local variables then
    local functions will behave like lambdas.
