  title: What is the purpose of the bitwise XOR (^) operator?
  text: The bitwise XOR operator compares two bits and if both are 1 or both are
    0 then it outputs 0, if only one of the elemnts is 1 and the other is 0 then
    it outputs 1. Essentially it helps you check where the bits are different.
