  title: What are bitwise shift operators and how do they function?
  text: 'Bitwise shift operators move the bits of an operand left (<<) or right (>>).

    Usually
    you start with the number 1 which has 0 on all bits except the rightmost one.

    Example
    with 4 bits: 0001 == 1

    Then for example you can shift to the left by 2
    which ends up with binary:

    1 << 2 == 0100 == 4'
