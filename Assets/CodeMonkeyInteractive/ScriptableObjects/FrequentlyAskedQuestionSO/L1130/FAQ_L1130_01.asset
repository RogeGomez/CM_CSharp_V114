  title: What is a function in programming, and why are they used?
  text: 'A function is a nice way to organize a piece of code into a single code
    block that can easily be called multiple times.

    One big benefit is reducing
    copy pasted code. If you have some logic that you use multiple times in your
    program/game, instead of copy pasting that logic tons of times you just make
    a function and you call that function when you need to.

    That also means
    that if you want to modify that logic you just have to modify it in a single
    place instead of multiple places.

    Technically you can write your entire
    program in just one giant Main() function. But separating logic into multiple
    functions is much better.

    So they are used to help with code reusability
    and simply to make your code much more understandable.
