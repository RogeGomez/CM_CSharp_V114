  title: How many parameters can I define in my function?
  text: 'As many as you want.

    Although remember the goal to keep your code as
    readable and understandable as possible. The more parameters you add to a function
    the harder it becomes to understand.

    If you have a function that requires
    a dozen parameters to work, perhaps consider defining a class or struct to hold
    that parameter data and replace all those parameters with a single parameter
    of that type.
