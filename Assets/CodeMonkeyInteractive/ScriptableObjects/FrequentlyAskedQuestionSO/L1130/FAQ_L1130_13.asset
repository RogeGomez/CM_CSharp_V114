  title: Can variables defined inside a function be accessed outside of it?
  text: 'No, variables that are defined in a function are local variables for that
    function and as such they do not exist outside the function.

    Same thing
    for function parameters, those are also local variables and are also inaccessible
    from outside.

    If you want to get data from a function you need to use the
    return type (or a reference type in a parameter, or an out parameter)
