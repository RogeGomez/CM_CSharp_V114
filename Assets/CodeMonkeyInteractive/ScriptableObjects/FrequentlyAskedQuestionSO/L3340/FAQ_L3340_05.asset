  title: What is the difference between Task.Wait() and await?
  text: 'Task.Wait() blocks the calling thread until the task completes, which can
    cause the UI to freeze if used on the main thread. In contrast, await does not
    block the calling thread; it allows other work to continue running while waiting
    for the task to complete, making it more suitable for applications with a responsive
    UI.
