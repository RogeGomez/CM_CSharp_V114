  title: How does Task relate to async and await?
  text: 'A Task represents an asynchronous operation. Task<T> extends Task to include
    a result of type T upon completion.

    When you use await on a Task, you tell
    the compiler to continue executing the Task in the background, and the surrounding
    function itself returns a Task to its caller.
