  title: What are the async and await keywords in C#?
  text: 'The async keyword is used to declare a function as asynchronous and indicates
    that the function contains one or more await expressions.

    The await keyword
    is used before a call to a function that returns a Task or Task<T>, signaling
    that the program should pause on that line of code until the task completes,
    while allowing other code to run.'
