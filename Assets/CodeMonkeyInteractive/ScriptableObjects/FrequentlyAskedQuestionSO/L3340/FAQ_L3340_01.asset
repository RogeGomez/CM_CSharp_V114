  title: What is asynchronous programming and why is it used?
  text: 'Asynchronous programming allows you to perform resource-intensive operations
    without blocking the main thread of your application, thus allowing you to keep
    the UI responsive.

    In C#, async and await are used to simplify the process
    of writing asynchronous code, which is especially useful in applications involving
    contacting a web server or doing some I/O tasks, your program doesn''t freeze
    while waiting for those to complete.
