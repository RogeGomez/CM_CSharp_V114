  title: What is the main goal of design patterns?
  text: 'Design patterns are essentially battle tested solutions for common programming
    problems that were created by very smart people.

    Chances are many of the
    programming problems you''re trying to solve have already been solved in the
    past and someone defined a design pattern speciically for that problem, it''s
    simpler to just know and apply the pattern as opposed to trying to come up with
    something brand new, there''s no need to reinvent the wheel yourself.
