  title: Do I have to memorize all these design patterns?
  text: 'No, there are hundreds of design patterns, some of which you might use all
    the time (like me and the Singleton and Observer patterns) and others you might
    never ever have to use.

    So it''s good to do some research to be aware of
    all the design patterns that exist and the types of problems they help solve,
    but don''t necessarily try to memorize them all in one go. As you write more
    and more code you will become more familiar with the common ones that you use
    all the time.
