  title: Can I deviate from the pattern slightly?
  text: 'Absolutely! Patterns are like clean code rules, they''re more guidelines
    to help you rather than laws that must never be broken.

    So always keep
    in mind what problem you''re trying to solve, and implement the pattern as much
    as it helps you.
