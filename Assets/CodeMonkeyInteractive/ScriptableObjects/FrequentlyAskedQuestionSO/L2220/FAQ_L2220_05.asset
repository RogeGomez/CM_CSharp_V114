  title: What are some real world use cases for generics?
  text: 'One example that I''ve used a lot myself is making a Grid System. I built
    one a long time ago and made it work with generics, because of that I was then
    able to reuse that same base class in multiple systems: Pathfinding, Factory
    Game, Grid Building System, House Building System, Turn Based Strategy, etc.

    Those
    all require some grid structure and different data on each grid position, so
    all of those use the same base class but with custom GridObject types.

    I
    only wrote the base class once and reused it in tons of completely different
    systems using different types.
