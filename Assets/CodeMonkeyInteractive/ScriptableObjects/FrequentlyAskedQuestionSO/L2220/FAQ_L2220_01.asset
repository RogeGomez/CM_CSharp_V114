  title: What are generics in C#, and why are they used?
  text: 'Generics allow your types to work with all kinds of types.

    One example
    is List<T> which you can use to make a List that holds ints, another one that
    holds strings, another one that holds Player objects and so on.

    Without
    generics you would need to define a separate List class for every type you wanted
    to use it with.

    Classes can use Generics, so can Interfaces and even individual
    functions.
