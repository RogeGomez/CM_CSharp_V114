  title: Is the class List<T> using a generic?
  text: 'Yes! That''s why you can make a list of any type, it''s thanks to the fact
    that the List class was defined to work with generics.

    If List was not
    defined using generics then you would need to make a ListInt, ListString, ListPlayer,
    etc, leading to a mountain of duplicated code.
