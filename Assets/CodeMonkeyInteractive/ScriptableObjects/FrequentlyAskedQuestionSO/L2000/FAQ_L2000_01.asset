  title: What should I know before starting the Intermediate section?
  text: "You should have fully understood everything in the beginner section. \nGo
    browse the lecture list, if there's one topic you didn't fully understand then
    go back to it and rewatch it. The beginner section contains the absolute basics
    upon which the intermediate section is built upon, so you should fully understand
    those before continuing.\n\nAlso if it's been a while since you saw the beginner
    section the go rewatch the lecture on Naming Rules and Clean Code Guidelines.
    Those 2 topics become more and more important as you move onto the intermediate
    stage."
