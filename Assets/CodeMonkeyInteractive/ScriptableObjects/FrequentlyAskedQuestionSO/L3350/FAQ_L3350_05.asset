  title: What is a deadlock and how can it be prevented?
  text: 'A deadlock occurs when two or more threads each hold a lock and are waiting
    for the other to release another lock before proceeding, thus none of the threads
    can progress.

    Deadlocks can be prevented by ensuring that all locks are
    always acquired in the same order, even if multiple locks are needed by different
    threads.
