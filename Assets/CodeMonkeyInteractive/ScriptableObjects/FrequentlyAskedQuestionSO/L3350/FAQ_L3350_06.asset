  title: "What\u2019s the difference between asynchronous programming and multithreading?"
  text: 'Asynchronous programming and multithreading both allow tasks to be performed
    in parallel with multiple code branches, but with a very big difference.

    In
    asynchronous programming you still have just one main thread, when you await
    something that code is not running at the same time on a separate thread, it''s
    just waiting for that code to finish executing and return a result, usually from
    an external source.

    Whereas with multithreading you do have multiple cores
    running code at the exact same time.

    Async is great for when some work
    is being done somewhere else, like a web server, and multithreading is great
    for when you want to use all CPU cores to the max.
