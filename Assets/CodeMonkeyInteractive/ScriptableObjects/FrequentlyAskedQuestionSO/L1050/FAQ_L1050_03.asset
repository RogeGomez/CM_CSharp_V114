  title: How do I install Unity Editor?
  text: 'You can install the Unity Editor through Unity Hub. After logging in, you
    can go to the ''Installs'' section to add a new version of Unity Editor.

    Alternatively,
    you can go to the projects tab, add the Unity Project for this course, and if
    you don''t have that version installed there should be a button where you can
    install it.
