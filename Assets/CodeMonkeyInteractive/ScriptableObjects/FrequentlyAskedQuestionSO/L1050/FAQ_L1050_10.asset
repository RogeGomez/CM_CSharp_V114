  title: How do I attach a script to a GameObject?
  text: 'After creating a script, you can attach it to a GameObject by dragging the
    script from the Project window onto the GameObject in the Hierarchy window or
    by adding it via the Add Component button in the Inspector window when the GameObject
    is selected.

    Remember how the script needs to extend MonoBehaviour in order
    to be used as a component.
