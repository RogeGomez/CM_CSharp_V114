  title: What is a script in Unity, and how do I create one?
  text: 'A script is a piece of code that allows you to add logic to your game objects.

    You
    can create a new script by right-clicking in the Project window, selecting Create
    - C# Script, then naming your script and attaching it to a game object.

    This
    creates a C# class which extends the Unity MonoBehaviour class. The script needs
    to extend this class in order to be added to a game object as a component.
