  title: How does auto-complete help?
  text: 'Auto complete helps you by letting you write code faster by typing less.

    You
    just need to get used to how it works, remember just how little of each symbol
    you need to write, so for example if you have a function TestFunction(); you
    can just type ''testf'' and press Enter and it will write everything else.

    Once
    you get used to it you can write a 50 character line of code by just typing 10
    characters.

    Importantly is how auto complete also makes sure to write the
    code perfectly with all the correct capitalization. This can be great for helping
    beginners avoid the most common mistakes.
