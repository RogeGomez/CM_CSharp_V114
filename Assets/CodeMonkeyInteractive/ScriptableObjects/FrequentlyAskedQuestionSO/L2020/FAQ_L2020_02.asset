  title: Isn't problem solving a more useful skill than knowing shortucts?
  text: 'The answer is both. Those two are not opposites, they work with one another.

    Knowing
    what code to write, being able to solve problems, is indeed an extremely useful
    skill, possibly the most useful skill to know as a programmer.

    But being
    able to efficiently take that code from your head and put it on screen is also
    an extremely useful skill.

    So the answer is both. Focus on becoming a better
    problem solver AND a faster coder. If you have both skills you will be extremely
    efficient.
