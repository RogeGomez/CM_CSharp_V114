  title: 'Am I expected to suddenly memorize all these shortcuts? '
  text: 'No!

    If you are just now learning about shortcuts it is perfectly normal
    that it takes you a while to memorize all of these.

    My advice is that you
    revisit this lecture periodically, and over time these shortcuts will become
    easier and easier to remember just like they are to me. But it''s normal that
    it takes some time, I''ve been writing code for 25 years so if you''re a beginner
    just take your time and slowly learn it.
