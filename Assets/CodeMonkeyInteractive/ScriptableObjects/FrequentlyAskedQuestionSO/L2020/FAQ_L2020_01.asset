  title: Why are shortcuts important? How do they help coding efficiency?
  text: 'Shortcuts help you by simply helping you take code from your head and put
    it on screen.

    One big way they help is by letting you keep your hands on
    your keyboard as much as possible. The less time you waste on moving your hand
    between your keyboard and your mouse the faster you will be.

    Ideally you
    just stare at your screen while your fingers and your brain does all the work.

    And
    in terms of why speed is important, the simplest answer is money. Time is money
    and the faster you can build a project the cheaper it will be.

    For example
    I believe my speed is a very important reason as to why I have managed to make
    so many profitable games, it''s because I can build in 6 months what takes someone
    else 2 years.

    If I need $1000 per month to live, then a project that takes
    me 6 months to build will need to make $6000 to turn a profit. Whereas a project
    that takes 2 years will need $24000, that''s a huge difference!
