  title: What are the steps you took to quickly copy an entire line?
  text: 'Use all the cursor shortcuts to quickly place the cursor on the line

    Then
    to select the entire line, press on End to place the cursor at the end. Then
    hold shift and press Up, this selects most of the line but also some part of
    the line above.

    Then while still holding shift press Home, this will make
    it so only the line you want is fully selected, it will also include a new line
    in the beginning which is important.

    Then press Ctrl + X to cut that line.
    Meaning delete and copy at the same time.

    Then again use all cursor shortcuts
    to go somewhere else.

    On the target line, press End to go to the end, then
    press Ctrl + V to paste it.

    If you''re just now starting to use shortcuts
    than this whole process might seem tricky, but after you learn it and it becomes
    muscle memory it comes automatically. I never manually think about all these
    steps, I just do them.
