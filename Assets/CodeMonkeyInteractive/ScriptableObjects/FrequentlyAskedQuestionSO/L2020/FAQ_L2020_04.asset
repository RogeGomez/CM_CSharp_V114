  title: What is the Ctrl + , shortcut, and how does it help in navigating a codebase?
  text: 'It brings up the Symbol Search window which allows you to search for any
    symbol (class, field, function, etc) in your entire codebase.

    Super useful
    to use that shortcut, type in the name of the class you want, press enter and
    the file is opened.

    Personally I never open classes by going into Unity
    and double clicking the file, I always just use this shortcut.
