  title: Why might someone prefer not to use properties?
  text: 'Personally I am not a fan of properties simply because they look like fields
    but act like functions.

    So I prefer to keep those separate, if I want to
    store data I use a field, if I want to do some logic I use a function.

    But
    that''s just personal preference, if you like properties go ahead and use them.
