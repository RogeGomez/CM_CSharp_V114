  title: How do class destructors work in C#?
  text: "Classes can have Constructors and a Destructor.\nWriting a destructor is
    similar to a constructor, you write the syntax by using the same name as the
    class and include any parameters you want. However unlike a constructor, before
    the name you write a tilde ~\n##REF##code,\r\n~Player() {\r\n    // Player destructor\r\n}\n##REF##\r\nThis
    code will run when a Player object is destroyed by the garbage collector."
