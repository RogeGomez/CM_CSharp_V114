  title: How does function overriding work? What is the purpose of the virtual and
    override keywords?
  text: 'You can override some implementation of some function, as long as you are
    inheriting from a base class and the base function is marked as virtual and the
    overriden one is marked as override.

    This allows you to run different logic
    depending on the type of the object you''re working with.

    For example you
    could have a base Unit class that has a Move(); function that uses AI to move
    the unit, and then a Player class that inherits from Unit but overrides the Move();
    function to use player input for movement.
