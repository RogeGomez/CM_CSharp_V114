  title: What is inheritance in C#?
  text: 'Inheritance is how you can have one class inherit from another class.

    Meaning
    it will inherit the base class''s functions, fields, events, etc.

    Then
    they can optionally be overriden to have a different implementation.

    And
    inheritance also includes polymorphism, meaning an object can be treated as either
    of being of the base type or the final type.
