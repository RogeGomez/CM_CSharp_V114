  title: Why is scope an important concept to master in programming?
  text: 'Scope is extremely important in helping you minimize access, which is one
    of the most important guidelines for writing good clean code.

    The more you
    limit the accessibility of some variable, the easier it is to keep in your mind
    all the ways in which that variable can be accessed.

    If you have a class
    with a thousand functions, and you make a class variable (field), then you have
    no idea which of those thousand functions might use that field.

    However
    if you have a thousand functions and in one of them you have a local variable,
    you know for certain that nothing else can touch that variable, so it does not
    matter if the class has a thousand or ten thousand functions. When working with
    that variable you know for sure that only code within that function can access/modify
    that variable.
