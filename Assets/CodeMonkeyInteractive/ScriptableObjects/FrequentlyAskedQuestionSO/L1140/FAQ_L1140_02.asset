  title: Why can't I access a variable defined in one function from another function?
  text: 'Because a local variable declared inside a function only exists within that
    function.

    As soon as the function code block ends, the local variables
    are disposed and no longer exist.

    If you want to get data from a function
    you need to use the return type (or a reference type in a parameter, or an out
    parameter)
