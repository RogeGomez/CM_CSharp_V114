  title: What does 'scope' mean in programming?
  text: "It simply means the accessibility/lifetime of some symbol (variable/function/class)\nIf
    you define a function local variable, the scope is only within that function.
    As soon as the function ends the local variable is disposed of so nothing else
    can access it.\nWhen it comes to scope, always remember to look at the curly
    braces. If you define something within a curly brace (class, function, etc) then
    that something is only accessible from within that code block and any child code
    blocks.\n##REF##code,\r\nint a = 5;\nif (true) {\n\ta++; // Valid because a was
    defined outside this code block\n\tint b = 3;\n}\nb++; // Error because b was
    defined in a child code block that no longer exists.\n##REF##"
