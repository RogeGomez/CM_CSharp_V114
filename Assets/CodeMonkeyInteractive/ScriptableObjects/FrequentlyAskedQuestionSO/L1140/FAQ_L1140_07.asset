  title: 'What is the difference between a local variable and a class variable (field)? '
  text: 'Local variables only exist where they are defined, so if declared inside
    a function they only exist within that function.

    Whereas a class variable
    (field) exists within that class and can be accessed by any code within that
    class.

    But both follow the same rule in that they only exist in the code
    block that they are defined in. So in that sense they are the same thing and
    all that matters is in what code block they are defined in.
