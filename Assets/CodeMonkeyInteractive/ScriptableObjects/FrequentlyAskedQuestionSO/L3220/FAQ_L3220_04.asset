  title: Can dynamic be used as a return type for functions?
  text: Yes, functions can use dynamic as a return type. This allows a function to
    return different types of objects based on runtime conditions, making it highly
    flexible in terms of the data it can return. Although always remember to prioritize
    code readability.
