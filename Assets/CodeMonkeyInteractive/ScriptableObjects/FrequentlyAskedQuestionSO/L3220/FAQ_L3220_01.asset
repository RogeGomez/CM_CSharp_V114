  title: What is a dynamic type in C#?
  text: 'The dynamic type is a data type that bypasses static type checking, meaning
    it does not validate your code against any known type at compile time.

    So
    you can access any field or call any function and the code will compile. Then
    during runtime it will try calling that function or accessing that field, and
    if nothing matches inside that type then it will throw an exception.'
