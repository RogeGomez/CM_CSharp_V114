  title: What are some examples of good beginner projects?
  text: 'In terms of general programming, good projects are things like making a
    Calculator, making a simple Number Guesser, a basic Chat Bot or a Countdown Timer.

    Then
    in terms of game development, good beginner projects are things like Flappy Bird,
    Pong, Space Invaders.

    I highly encourage you to build some tiny projects
    to really solidify all the knoweldge you have gained throughout the beginner
    section of this course.

    In terms of game development, if you''re looking
    for a guided step by step path then check out my Kitchen Chaos course, in there
    you can see how I use lots of the elements we covered in a real game.
