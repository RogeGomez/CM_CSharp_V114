  title: What is the purpose of creating small projects? Should I build some?
  text: 'Yup you should definitely spend some time creating small projects.

    The
    reason why I put so much effort into building the interactive exercises for this
    course is because you truly learn when you actually take the time to write some
    code yourself.

    If you just blindly watch course after course you won''t
    learn much, you need to actually put what you learned into practice.

    So
    yes I highly advise you to make tiny simple projects to really put your knowledge
    to the test.

    Although always remember that it''s perfectly normal to google
    things, programming isn''t about memorization so you''re not expected to have
    memorized everything in all the courses. As a programmer your main skill is problem
    solving and by going through all these courses you learned and hopefully actually
    solved all kinds of problems.

    Now with that knowledge you can go build
    some simple projects which will help really solidify that knowledge.
