  title: Can const or readonly be used with static fields?
  text: 'const cannot be static since constants are static by default, constants
    always belong to the class itself and not any instance of that class, like static.

    However
    readonly fields can indeed be either static or non-static. If you want a readonly
    field to behave similarly to a constant, make it static.
