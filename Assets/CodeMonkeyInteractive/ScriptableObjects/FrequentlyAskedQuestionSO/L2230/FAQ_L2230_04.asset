  title: When should I use const/readonly?
  text: 'When there is some sort of value that never changes.

    For example if
    you have a game where your player speed is meant to be constant, there are no
    upgrades and the value should never change, then make it a constant.

    That
    way if you accidentally modify it you will get a compiler error.

    And if
    you have some value that is meant to be constant but has a type that cannot be
    used with const, if so then use readonly.
