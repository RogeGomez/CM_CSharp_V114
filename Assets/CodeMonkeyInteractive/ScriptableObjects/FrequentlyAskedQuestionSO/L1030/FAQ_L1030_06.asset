  title: Is it okay if I take longer to understand the course material?
  text: '<b>Absolutely!</b>

    Programming is a pretty complex skill and learning
    it does take time, so you are definitely <b>NOT</b> expected to go through this
    course in a day or a week or even a month.


    Remember this is <b>YOUR</b>
    learning journey, the only thing that matters is that you''re learning, that''s
    it, the time does not matter as long as you are learning.


    So go slow, take
    your time, make sure to fully understand every lecture before going onto the
    next one, read all the FAQs, do all the Quizzes and Exercises.

    If you take
    your time and pay attention then I guarantee by the end you will have gained
    a <b>TON of knowledge.</b>
