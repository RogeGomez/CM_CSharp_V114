  title: What is the best way to ask a question to ensure I get a helpful answer?
  text: "When asking questions, be as <b>specific</b> as possible. Describe <b>EXACTLY
    </b>what you expected to happen versus what actually happened, include any <b>error
    messages</b> and the lines of code where the errors occur. \n\r\nThe more detail
    you provide, the easier it will be for me to help you solve whatever the problem
    is.\n\r\nSo don't just say <i>\"it's not working\"</i> since there's nothing
    I can do to help with such little information. Be <b>very specific</b> on what
    exactly isn't working, any errors in the console or any unintended behaviour.\r\n"
