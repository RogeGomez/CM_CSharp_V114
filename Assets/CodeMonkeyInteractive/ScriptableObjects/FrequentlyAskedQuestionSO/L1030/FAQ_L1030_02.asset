  title: How can I effectively use this Unity project to learn better?
  text: 'This Unity project contains a wealth of information, there''s FAQs for each
    lecture, which can clarify some doubts. There are quizzes which help you solidify
    the knowledge you gained in each lecture, and exercises to put what you learn
    into practice.

    So the way you do it is by doing all of that. Always remember
    that your goal is to learn, not to speed through this course. <b>Take your time</b>
    to go through every piece of knowledge in this course and by the end you will
    have learned a ton.
