  title: How can I get my questions answered quickly?
  text: 'You can just post a question in the Lecture Comments and the Bot will provide
    an automatic reply within 2-3 minutes. Since the bot was trained on the contents
    of the course it should be very helpful.

    Then over the next 24 hours, I
    myself will manually answer the question.
