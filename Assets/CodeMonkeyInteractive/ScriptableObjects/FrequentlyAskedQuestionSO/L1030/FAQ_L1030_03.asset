  title: What can I do if I encounter errors in my code?
  text: 'First just make sure you write the code perfectly. The main cause of errors
    for beginners is simply forgetting that everything matters in the code. Capitalization
    matters, where you place a semi-colon <b>;</b> matters, how many opening and
    closing curly braces <b>{ }</b> you have matters.

    So always double and triple
    check that you''re writing code properly.


    Then just place the mouse over
    the error, for simple errors like a missing ; the error itself will help you.


    Then
    watch the lecture covering common errors, in there I cover a lot of the common
    beginner errors along with what they mean and how to solve them.

    Also here
    in the Unity project make sure you have the <b>Code Monkey Companion window</b>
    open, that window will provide extra clarification on a ton of errors.

    And
    as always I''m available in the <b>Lecture Comments,</b> so if there''s something
    you cannot solve just post a question and I''ll do my best to help.
