  title: What should I do if I don't understand a concept or lecture?
  text: 'It''s normal to find some concepts confusing at first so don''t feel bad
    about yourself. Programming is a complex skill and learning it takes time, I''ve
    been writing code for 25 years and I''m still learning new things.

    Make
    sure to read through the Frequently Asked Questions for each lecture, do the
    Quizzes, and all the Interactive Exercises.

    The more you actively try to
    learn, the more you actually put your knowledge into practice, the more you will
    actually learn.

    And of course if you do all that and still don''t understand
    anything feel free to post a question in the Lecture Comments, I read and answer
    those every day so if you have some question I''ll do my best to help.
