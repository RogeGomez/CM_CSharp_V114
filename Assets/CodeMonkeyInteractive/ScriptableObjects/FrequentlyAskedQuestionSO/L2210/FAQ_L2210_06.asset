  title: What is the EventHandler delegate?
  text: 'This is the standard delegate for handling events, it can be customized
    with custom EventArgs classes to pass in any data you want.

    You are not
    required to use it, you can make an event using any delegate type like Action
    or a custom delegate, but the C# standard makes sense and is pretty easy to use.
