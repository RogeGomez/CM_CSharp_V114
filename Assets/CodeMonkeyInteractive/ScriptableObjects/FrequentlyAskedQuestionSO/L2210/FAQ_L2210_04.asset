  title: What happens if you don't unsubscribe from an event?
  text: 'Then that class will continue receiving events whenever they are fired,
    which can cause errors if the listener object dies but the event publisher keeps
    firing events.

    In Unity you can make sure to always unsubscribe to events
    with the OnDestroy MonoBehaviour function.
