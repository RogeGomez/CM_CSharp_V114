  title: What are the differences between using delegates and events? Why use the
    event keyword?
  text: 'The event keyword applies several limitations that help protect you from
    yourself.

    Without the ''event'' keywrod then any class can subscribe +=
    unsubscribe -= and also invoke the event() or even set it to = null clearning
    all the listeners.

    Whereas if you add the keyword, the only class that
    can invoke or set it to null is the class that defines the event, other classes
    can only subscribe or unsubscribe.
