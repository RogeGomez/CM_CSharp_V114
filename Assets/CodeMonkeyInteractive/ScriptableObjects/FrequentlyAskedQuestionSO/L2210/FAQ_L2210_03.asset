    some HealthBarUI class to listen to that event:\n##REF##code,\r\nplayer.OnDamaged
    += Player_OnDamaged;\r\n\r\nprivate void Player_OnDamaged() {\r\n    // Player
    was damaged\r\n}\r\n\r##REF##\nTo unsubscribe you just do the reverse\n##REF##code,\r\nplayer.OnDamaged
    -= Player_OnDamaged;\r\n##REF##"
