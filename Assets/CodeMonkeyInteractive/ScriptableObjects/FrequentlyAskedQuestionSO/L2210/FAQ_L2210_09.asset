  title: What are the best practices for managing event subscriptions to avoid memory
    leaks?
  text: 'You can simply remember to always unsubscribe from events, in Unity you
    can use the OnDestroy function or in C# you can use the ~Class destructor.

    Although
    if both event publisher and listener have the same lifetime then technically
    you don''t need to unsubscribe, since both objects will be destroyed at the same
    time therefore there will be no dangling listeners.
