  title: What is the null-conditional operator? Why is it used with events?
  text: "It is the shorthand for testing against null, and if not null continue executing
    some code.\r\nIn events it is especially helpful since you always need to test
    against null, using the null-conditional operator makes the code very compact
    and easy to read.\n##REF##code,\r\nif (OnDamaged != null) {\r\n    OnDamaged();\r\n}\r\n------------------\r\nOnDamaged?.Invoke();\r\n##REF##"
