  title: What is an event in C#, and how does it work?
  text: 'Events are how you can have one class notify some other class that something
    has happened.

    You define an event in some class, then any other class can
    subscribe or listen to that event, and when that event is fired all the other
    classes will be notified.

    One common example in game development is for
    handling logic and UI. If your Player has some health system, you usually have
    some sort of OnDamaged event that the HealthBarUI will listen to which will update
    itself whenever the event is fired.
