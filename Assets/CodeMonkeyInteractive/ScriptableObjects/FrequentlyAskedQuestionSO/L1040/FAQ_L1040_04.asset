  title: What are top-level statements? What is the alternative?
  text: 'Top-level statements lets you just write code directly and it will run from
    top to bottom.

    Without it, you need to define a class with some Main function
    that will be the program entry point.

    So for beginners the top-level statements
    is the better approach since it greatly simplifies the code you need to write.
