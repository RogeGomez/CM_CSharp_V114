  title: What is Console.WriteLine()?
  text: 'It prints a line of text to the console.

    In technical terms, Console
    is a class, WriteLine is a function within that class and it takes some text
    as a parameter.

    All of those topics, Classes, Functions, Parameters, are
    covered in detail in future lectures.
