  title: What is a Console app and why are we starting with it?
  text: 'It''s just a console that runs some code. So there are no visuals, no mouse
    clicks, no complex inputs, just basic text.

    It''s a great starting point
    because of how simple it is. After you learn the absolute basics with just a
    simple text console app, then you can take that knowledge and use it with something
    that allows you to build a visual interface on top of that logic, like Unity
    or WinForms.
