  title: Do we need to install the Viasfora extension?
  text: "You don't absolutely need to (the code will compile the same, it's just
    a visual) but I highly recommend it. \r\nAdding some colors to the code makes
    it much easier to read and parse all the various parenthesis and code blocks
    that exist in your code.\r\n"
