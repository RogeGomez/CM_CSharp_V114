  title: What are some best practices for writing comments in C#?
  text: 'The first best practice is simply first try to avoid them, try to choose
    good names for your variables and functions to make your code clear just by reading
    the code.

    But sometimes even though the code is clear it could use some
    extra clarification, this is where you can write a comment

    So in general
    don''t write comments that just explain what the code is doing, the code should
    be readable enough that you understand what it''s doing just by reading the code.

    Instead
    comments should be used more to explain the why behind the code.
