  title: Is it possible to add comments before a line of code?
  text: 'With the single line method you can''t because anything after the double
    slashes is considered a comment until a new line.

    All of this is a comment,
    there is no age variable defined:

    ##REF##code,

    // comment; int age
    = 35;

    ##REF##


    But yes you can add comments before with the multi-line
    method, like this:

    ##REF##code,

    /* comment */ int age = 35;

    ##REF##


    However
    you should avoid this at all costs, making comments in the beginning of the line
    can make the code really confusing and hard to read.

    So usually you should
    only write comments either on their own line or at the end of the line after
    the code.
