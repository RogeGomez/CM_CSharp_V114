  title: Do comments affect how a program runs?
  text: 'No, comments are completely ignored by the compiler as if they don''t even
    exist.

    So you can write any text you want, even something that would be
    valid code, and it won''t affect execution because the compiler will completely
    ignore any text in a comment.
