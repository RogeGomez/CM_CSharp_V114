  title: Can comments be used to temporarily disable parts of code?
  text: 'Yup you can definitely do this. I do it all the time when writing some new
    system and I want to try out various approaches.

    However only do this temporarily.
    After your code is solid and it''s doing exactly what you want it to do, after
    that go back and remove the old commented code.

    If you don''t, then later
    on when you come back to that code you will not remember why you commented it
    out.

    So it''s okay to comment out code temporarily while trying out various
    approaches, but remember to clean it up afterwards.
