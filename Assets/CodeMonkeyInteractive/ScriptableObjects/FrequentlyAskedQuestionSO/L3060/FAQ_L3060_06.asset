  title: Is there a performance benefit to using nameof?
  text: 'When compared to reflection, yes, there is a small performance benefit.

    Since
    nameof is evaluated at compile time and replaced with the actual name as a string
    literal in the compiled code, it avoids any runtime performance costs.'
