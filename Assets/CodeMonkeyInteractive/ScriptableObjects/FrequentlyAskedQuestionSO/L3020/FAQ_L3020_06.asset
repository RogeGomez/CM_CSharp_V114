  title: Is reflection efficient?
  text: 'Reflection is slower than directly calling functions or accessing fields
    because it requires inspecting metadata and performing operations dynamically.

    In
    most cases you should use normal code, you should only use Reflection when it''s
    the only way to achieve what you''re trying to do.'
