  title: How do you instantiate a record?
  text: 'You instantiate a record just like how you instantiate any other object.

    ##REF##code,

    Person
    person = new Person("Code", "Monkey");

    ##REF##

    Then you can access
    person.FirstName and person.LastName

    However remember how by default records
    are immutable, meaning you cannot modify those properties after creating the
    record, you can only read their data.'
