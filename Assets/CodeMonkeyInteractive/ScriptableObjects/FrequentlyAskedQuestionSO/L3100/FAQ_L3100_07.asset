  title: Can records inherit from other records?
  text: 'Yes, records can inherit from other records. This allows you to create a
    hierarchy of records, where derived records inherit properties from their base
    records, just like normal class inheritance:

    ##REF##code,

    public record
    Vehicle(int Wheels);

    public record Car(int Doors, int Wheels) : Vehicle(Wheels);

    ##REF##'
