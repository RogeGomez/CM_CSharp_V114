  title: Can you modify a record after it's created?
  text: 'By default, records are immutable, meaning you cannot change their properties
    after instantiation.

    However, you can create a new record based on an existing
    one using the ''with'' expression, which allows you to specify new values for
    some properties.

    ##REF##code,

    Person updatedPerson = person with {
    LastName = "Gorilla" };

    ##REF##

    Remember how this does not modify the
    original ''person'', it simply creates a new one and overwrites some properties.



    And
    technically you can manually implement the properties with a get; and set; to
    make them mutable. However you really should not do this, records are intended
    to be simple immutable data containers.'
