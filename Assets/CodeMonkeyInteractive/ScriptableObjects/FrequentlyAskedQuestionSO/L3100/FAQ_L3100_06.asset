  title: Are records reference types or value types?
  text: 'Defining a record using just the ''record'' keyword is equivalent to ''record
    class'' which makes it a reference type. As opposed to ''record struct'' which
    makes it a value type.

    However if you define a ''record class'' it will
    be a reference type but behave like a value type in terms of equality. Two record
    instances are considered equal if all their properties are equal, not based on
    their reference.

    ##REF##code,

    Person person1 = new Person("Code", "Monkey");

    Person
    person2 = new Person("Code", "Monkey");

    Console.WriteLine(person1 == person2);
    // true

    // If person was a normal class it would be false
