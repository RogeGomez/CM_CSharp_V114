  title: What is a Namespace in C#?
  text: 'Namespaces are kind of like folders that allow you to organize your code
    in a better way as opposed to having thousands of classes all in the same place.

    There
    are various built-in namespaces that have all kinds of classes inside it.

    System
    has lots of general system-wide classes, like Console

    System.IO has various
    classes about input-output like File

    System.Collection.Generic contains
    various generic collections like List<T>

    UnityEngine.UI contains lots of
    classes related to Unity UI
