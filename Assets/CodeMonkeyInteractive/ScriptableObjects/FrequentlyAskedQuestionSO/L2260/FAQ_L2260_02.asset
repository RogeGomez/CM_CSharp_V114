  title: How do you decide when to create a new namespace?
  text: 'There''s no hard rule but it''s whenever you feel like your code could be
    better organized into namespaces.

    There''s no cost to creating a namespace,
    no inherent cost to having too many or too few, so it really is whatever you
    prefer.
