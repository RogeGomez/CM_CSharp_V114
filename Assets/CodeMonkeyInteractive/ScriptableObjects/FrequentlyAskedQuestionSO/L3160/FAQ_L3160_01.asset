  title: What is Span<T> in C#?
  text: 'Span<T> is a type that allows you to work with contiguous regions of memory
    such as slices of arrays or entire arrays, without creating additional memory
    allocations.

    This gives you a way to access a portion of an array in a
    very memory-efficient manner.'
