  title: What operations can you perform with Span<T>?
  text: 'With Span<T>, you can perform many of the same operations you do with an
    array, you can access elements, you can sort them, you can slice it further,
    fill it with elements and so on.

    Importantly is how since Span does not
    create a new object, any changes made to the Span will change the original data.'
