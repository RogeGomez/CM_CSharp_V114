  title: What is the null-coalescing assignment operator and how is it used?
  text: 'The null-coalescing assignment operator (??=) assigns a value to a variable
    only if that variable is currently null.

    ##REF##code,

    List<Player>
    playerList = null;

    playerList ??= new List<Player>();

    ##REF##

    This
    will initialize ''playerList'' with a new List<Player> only if ''playerList''
    is currently null.

    So it is great for handling initialization.'
