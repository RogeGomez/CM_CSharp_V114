  title: Can the null-coalescing operator be used with non-nullable value types?
  text: 'No, the null-coalescing operator can only be used with nullable types.

    To
    use it with value types, like int, you must make them nullable, for example int?
    instead of int.

    There is a lecture on Nullables later on in the course.'
