  title: Should I read all FAQs, do all Quizzes and Exercises for every lecture?
  text: 'YES!

    If you truly want to learn, which I assume you do, then yes take
    your time and do all the content related to every single lecture.

    Remember
    that your goal is simply to learn, it is not to speed through the course. So
    you should NOT sprint through this course in a few days, if you''re really trying
    to learn then you should take your time and do everything related to every single
    lecture.

    I put my 10+ years of C# knowledge into this course, if you take
    your time and do everything you will gain the knowledge that I have in just a
    few months which is insanely fast.

    So take your time, do all the content
    related to every single lecture, and by the end you will have gained a massive
    amount of knowledge!
