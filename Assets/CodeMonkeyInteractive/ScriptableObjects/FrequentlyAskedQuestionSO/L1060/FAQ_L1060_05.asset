  title: What is the Exercises window?
  text: 'This window contains all the interactive exercises for each Lecture.

    You
    can select the exercise read the instructions and then Start it, doing so will
    copy some files onto the project which you need to modify in some way in order
    to complete the exercise.

    Some exercises just require you to write some
    code while others require you to write some code and then press Play in Unity
    to test your code.

    If you get stuck you can always read the exercise Hint
    which should help.

    Or if you get really really stuck then you can read
    and apply the solution to the exercise.

    Then you should watch the exercise
    walkthrough, this is a video where I go through the exercise myself and explain
    further what the exercise is testing and what you should learn from it.

    Then
    you can click on the Complete Exercise button which will remove the testing files
    so you can move onto the next exercise.
