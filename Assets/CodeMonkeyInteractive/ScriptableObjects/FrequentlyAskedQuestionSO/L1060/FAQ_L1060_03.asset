  title: What is the Frequently Asked Questions window?
  text: 'This window contains the Frequently Asked Questions for each Lecture.

    There
    are multiple questions along with very detailed answers.

    These usually help
    clarify some things on each lecture or merely rephrase some things in a different
    way to really reinforce what you learned in the lecture.
