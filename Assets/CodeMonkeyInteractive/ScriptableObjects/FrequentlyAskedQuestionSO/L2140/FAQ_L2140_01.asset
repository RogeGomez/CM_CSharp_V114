  title: What is a struct in C#, and how does it differ from a class?
  text: 'A struct is a structure of data, and just like classes it can store data
    in fields, it can have functions, implement interfaces and so on.

    The main
    difference is how structs are value types whereas classes are reference types.

    Also
    they cannot inherit from a base class or base struct.
