  title: Can you perform actions with the ternary conditional operator, or is it
    only for value assignment?
  text: 'The primary use of the ternary operator is for value assignment.

    However
    technically you can use functions or methods that return a value. But again while
    this is technically possible it will likely lead to readability issues, so only
    use the ternary conditional operator for simple conditions.'
