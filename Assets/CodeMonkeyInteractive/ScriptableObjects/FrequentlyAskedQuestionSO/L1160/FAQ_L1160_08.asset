  title: What are lists and how do they differ from arrays?
  text: 'Lists are built on top of Arrays and provide extra functionality.

    Main
    difference is how arrays are fixed and cannot be resized, whereas Lists have
    a dynamic size where you can Add(); or Remove(); elements.

    In the background
    what the list is doing is simply keeping track of an internal array, and when
    you Add(); an element to the list it will resize the internal array with length+1
    and copy all the elements to the new array and add your new element.
