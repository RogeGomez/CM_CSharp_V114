  title: Can a class itself be declared as private or public?
  text: 'Depends on where you are writing.

    If you are defining that class as
    a child of another class then yes and the same rules apply.

    If you make
    it private then only the parent class can access that class.

    However if
    you are defining that class as a main class inside a namespace then it must be
    public.
