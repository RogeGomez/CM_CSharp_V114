  title: Why shouldn't I make everything public?
  text: 'By making it public you are making it accessible from any other class in
    your entire codebase. That means if you have some bug it could be coming from
    anywhere.

    So in general you should minimize access as much as possible,
    that way when you encounter a bug it is much easier to think of where the bug
    might be coming from because it can only come from that one class and nothing
    else.

    Always make everything private by default, only make it public if
    you absolutely need to.

    I made an entire video on this particular topic
    and I''m going to talk about it more in the Clean Code Guidelines lecture.
