  title: What is the difference between public and private access modifiers?
  text: 'public means it is accessible from anywhere.

    So if you mark a field
    as public then any class in your entire codebase can access and modify that field.

    Whereas
    if you mark it as private, then only that class itself can ever access or modify
    that field. It does not matter if you have 10 classes or 1000 classes in your
    entire project, only that class can access it.

    This means that as you write
    code if there is a bug in a private field you know for certain the bug can only
    exist within that class since nothing else can access it.
