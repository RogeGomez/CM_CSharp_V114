  title: Can I avoid using the singleton pattern?
  text: "Sure! \r\nThe singleton pattern can be very useful but as with anything
    with programming it's just a tool that you can either use or not use.\r\nIf you
    want to avoid using singletons you just need to pass the reference somehow.\r\nFor
    example if your player wants to add some score to some ScoreManager, you can
    either use ScoreManager.Instance.AddScore(); or pass in a reference to the ScoreManager
    to the Player through some function/field and use that direct reference instead
    of the singleton.\r\n"
