  title: How does the GetType() function do? What is typeof?
  text: 'The GetType() function returns the Type of that object.

    For example
    if you do myInt.GetType() you get System.Int32

    If you have a player class
    and do player.GetType() you get Player

    The typeof keyword is similar, but
    rather than being applied to an object of a certain type you use it on the type
    itself

    ##REF##code,

    myInt.GetType(); // System.Int32

    typeof(int);
    // System.Int32

    ##REF##

    The Type type is extremely useful when working
    with reflection which lets you inspect all kinds of things of a particular type,
    like what functions it contains. There is a lecture on Reflection in the Advanced
    section.
