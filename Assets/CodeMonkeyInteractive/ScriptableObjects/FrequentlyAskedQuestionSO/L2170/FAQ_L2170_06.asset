  title: How does inheritance affect the ability to convert between types? What about
    interfaces? Polymorphism?
  text: "You can convert freely between any inheritance type or interface.\r\nIf
    you have a Player class that extends Unit and implement IDamageable, this is
    all valid code.\n##REF##code,\r\nPlayer player = new Player();\r\nif (player
    is Unit) {\r\n    Unit playerUnit = player as Unit; // Although the 'as' isn't
    needed here, due to polymorphism\r\n}\r\nif (player is IDamageable) {\r\n   
    IDamageable playerDamageable = player as IDamageable; // Although the 'as' isn't
    needed here, due to polymorphism\r\n}\r\n##REF##"
