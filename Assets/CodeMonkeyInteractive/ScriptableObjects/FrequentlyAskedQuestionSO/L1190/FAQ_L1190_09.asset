  title: How do I decide when to make something static or non-static?
  text: 'It depends whether what you''re trying to build is meant to be something
    that each individual instance of that class is meant to have, or if it''s something
    that the type itself should have.

    For example, on a Player class the playerName
    should probably be non-static so that different players can have different names

    But
    then a field to store the totalNumberOfAllPlayerKills should be static since
    it represents data from all players.
