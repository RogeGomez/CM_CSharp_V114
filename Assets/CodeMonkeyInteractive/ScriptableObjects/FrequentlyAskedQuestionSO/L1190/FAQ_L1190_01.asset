  title: What does the static keyword mean in C#?
  text: 'It means that you are defining something as belonging to the class itself
    and not any instance of that class.

    For example a static field belongs
    to the class itself and not any instance of that class.

    If you have a Player
    class with a static playerName then it does not matter how many players you create,
    there is only ever one instance of that static playerName field.
