  title: Can a class be declared as static? What does that mean?
  text: 'Yes, if you mark a class as static then you are required to define everything
    inside that class as static. Meaning all fields, properties and functions need
    to be marked as static.

    If you want everything to be static, make the entire
    class static.

    If you want to mix static and non-static leave the class
    itself as non-static.
