  title: How does a static field differ from a non-static field?
  text: 'A static field belongs to the class itself and not any instance of that
    class.

    So to access that field you access it through the class name itself.

    For
    example if this field is defined in a Player class, you access it like:

    ##REF##code,

    public
    static string playerName;

    ---------------

    Player.playerName = "Code
    Monkey";

    ##REF##

    If you do this following code it will give an error
    because you cannot access a static field from an instance of the class.

    ##REF##code,

    Player
    player = new Player();

    player.playerName = "Code Monkey";

    ##REF##'
