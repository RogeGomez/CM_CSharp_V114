  title: What does the sizeof operator do in C#?
  text: 'The sizeof operator is used to determine the size, in bytes, of value types
    like int, float, bool, etc. It tells you how much memory a particular data type
    uses.

    For example each ''int'' is stored in 4 bytes, so if you want to
    store 10 int''s you need 40 bytes of memory.'
