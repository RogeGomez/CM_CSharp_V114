  title: What is Marshal.SizeOf() used for?
  text: 'Marshal.SizeOf() is a function used to get the size of a type or an instance
    of a type in bytes, including reference types, albeit with some limitations.

    The
    entire Marshal class is all about handling data and converting it back and forth
    between managed and unmanaged.'
