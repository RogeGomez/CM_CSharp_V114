  title: Can I use sizeof in safe context? Or does it need unsafe?
  text: 'Yes, sizeof can be used in safe context for built-in value types.

    However,
    if you need to use sizeof on custom structs or get the size of pointer types,
    you must operate in an unsafe context. There is a lecture later on in the Advanced
    section on the topic of ''unsafe'' in C#.'
