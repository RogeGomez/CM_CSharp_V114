  title: What naming rules should I follow if I'm working in a team?
  text: 'If this is a team you are joining then they likely have already defined
    a code style so you should follow the rules they have already set.

    Don''t
    try to impose your own rules. Remember the most important thing is consistency,
    so if you are joining an already existing project then adapt your code to their
    rules.
