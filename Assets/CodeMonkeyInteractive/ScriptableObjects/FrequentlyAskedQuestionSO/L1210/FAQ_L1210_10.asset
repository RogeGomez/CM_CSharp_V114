  title: What does the prefix m_ mean? Should I use it?
  text: 'Usually it means ''member'' and is usually applied to class member fields.

    Like
    I said naming rules can be whatever you want, as long as you are consistent.

    So
    personally I do not follow this rule, personally I don''t find it helpful, I
    think it just adds needless noise, but that''s just me.

    A lot of people
    do like that prefix so if that''s you go ahead and use it.
