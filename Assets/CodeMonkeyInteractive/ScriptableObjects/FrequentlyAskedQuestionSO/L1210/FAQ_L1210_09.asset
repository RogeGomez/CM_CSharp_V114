  title: If I name a variable something, can I change the name later?
  text: 'YES! Always remember that names are not set in stone. Sometimes you give
    something a name that sounds good at the time, and later on you think of a better
    name, that''s okay.

    If that happens just take a few seconds to rename that
    function to the new better name.

    Code is NOT set in stone. Refactoring
    is a perfectly normal and very important part of the process.

    There is
    a lecture dedicated to Refactoring on the Intermediate section because it is
    a very important topic.
