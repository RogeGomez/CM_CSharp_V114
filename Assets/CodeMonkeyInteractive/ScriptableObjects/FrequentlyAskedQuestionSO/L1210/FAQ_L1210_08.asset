  title: What are some common mistakes beginners make with regards to naming conventions?
    Not being consistent
  text: 'The biggest mistake is simply not following any rules.

    If you write
    one variable using PascalCase and the next variable using camelCase and another
    one using snake_case (or even worse just make it all lowercase)

    If you
    do that then the code becomes really hard to understand since there''s no logic
    to anything.

    The other big mistake is simply not being consistent.

    If
    you follow one set of rules for one file and another set of rules for another
    file, then it becomes really hard to quickly switch back and forth.

    So
    pick a set of naming rules and follow them all the time.
