  title: What are some good resources to learn more about naming rules and good code
    practices? Code Complete, Kitchen Chaos
  text: 'I highly highly recommend the book Code Complete 2.

    It is absolutely
    excellent and reading through that whole book has increased my own programming
    skills 100x!

    It''s definitely a thick book with 800 pages so it will take
    you a while to get through it, but if you do and you fully understand everytihng
    you will massively improve your skills as a programmer.

    Or if you want
    to see me apply my own rules you can check out my courses, specifically my Kitchen
    Chaos course which is targeted at beginners but despite that the code quality
    is on the same level as my own professional games, following all the code naming
    rules that I follow myself.
