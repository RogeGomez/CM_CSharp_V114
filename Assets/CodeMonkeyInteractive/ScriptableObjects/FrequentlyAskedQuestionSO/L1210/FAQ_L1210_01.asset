  title: What are naming rules in programming, and why are they important?
  text: 'These are the rules that you follow in naming your various symbols (functions,
    variables, properties, etc)

    They are EXTREMELY important. Following a consistent
    set of rules is the easiest way to massively improve the quality of your code.

    If
    you don''t follow any naming rules your code will be a mess and really hard to
    understand.
