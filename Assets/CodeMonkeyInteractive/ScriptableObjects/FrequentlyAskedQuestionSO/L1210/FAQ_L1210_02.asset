  title: What are the best naming rules? Which ones should I follow?
  text: 'There are no ''best'' naming rules, you can follow pretty much any naming
    rules you want, the most important thing is that you are consistent.

    Don''t
    write one file using one set of rules and another one following a completely
    different set of rules. Be consistent.

    In the lecture I talk about my own
    naming rules that I have defined in over 10 years of working with C# but you
    don''t have to follow my own, there are plenty of different valid code styles.
