  title: What is a real world example of where switch cases are commonly used?
  text: "One common use case, in game development, is building a simple State Machine.\nThis
    is widely used when making some AI code where you want different logic to run
    depending on the state of the unit.\n##REF##code,\nswitch (state) {\n    case
    State.Patrolling:\n       // Patrol logic\n       break;\n    case State.MovingTowardsTarget:\n      
    // Move towards target\n        break;\n    case State.AttackingTarget:\n      
    // Attack target\n       break;\n}\n##REF##\nIn this case state is an Enum, I
    cover enums later on in the Intermediate section of the course.\n"
