  title: What does unsafe mean in C#?
  text: 'The unsafe keyword is used to denote a block of code that uses pointer manipulation.

    This
    code block is called "unsafe" because it bypasses the C# type safety system,
    allowing direct memory access and manipulation, which can lead to security risks,
    data corruption, and crashes if not handled carefully.'
