  title: How do you enable unsafe code in a C# project?
  text: To enable unsafe code, you must configure your C# project settings. This
    is done by going to the project properties, finding the "Build" tab, and checking
    the "Allow unsafe code" box. Additionally, the compilation of unsafe code can
    be enabled with the /unsafe option in the C# compiler.
