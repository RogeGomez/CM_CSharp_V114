  title: What is identation? Why doesn't it affect the code?
  text: "Identation is the empty space used to visually organize the code, like in
    this example:\n##REF##code, \nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello\");\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Code\");\n\t\t\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Monkey\");\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"!\");\n##REF##\nIt
    has no meaning for the compiler, you can ident in any way you want and it won't
    affect the way the code works.\nBut it does impact readability so you should
    definitely ident your code properly, it should be easy to see at a glance what
    code belongs to what code block"
