  title: What are code blocks?
  text: "That's the code within curly braces { }\nA code block basically groups together
    some code. \nFor example all the code that belongs to a function will be in that
    function's code block, all the code that belongs to an if will be in that if's
    code block, etc.\nAlways pay close attention to where you are writing code. Depending
    on where you are writing (which code block) will impact what code you can write.
    \nFor example you cannot write a regular instruction like Console.WriteLine();
    just inside a class code block, only inside a function code block.\n"
