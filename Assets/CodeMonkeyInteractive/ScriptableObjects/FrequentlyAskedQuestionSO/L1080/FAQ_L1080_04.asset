  title: What if I forget to write a semi-colon?
  text: 'If you don''t write a semi-colon then the compiler does not know when the
    instruction ends and just keeps reading the code as if it were all one instruction
    which will likely lead to errors.

    Remember how for the compiler the new
    lines in the text don''t mean anything, all that matters are the semi colons
    ; and code blocks { }

'
