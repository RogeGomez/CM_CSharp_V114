  title: I see some error! Help!
  text: 'Check the Common Errors lecture for a bunch of common errors.

    Check
    your capitalization, remember that code is case-sensitive

    Check where you
    are writing the code, you probably want to be writing inside some function

    Check
    your ''using'' statements up top, in order to use Console.WriteLine(); you need
    ''using System;''

    And check the Code Monkey Companion window, it provides
    extra clarifications on various errors and what might be causing them.
