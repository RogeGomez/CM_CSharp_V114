  title: What does it mean that C# is case sensitive?
  text: "It means that for example <b>'int'</b> and <b>'Int'</b> are two completely
    different symbols that refer to completely different things. Changing something
    from lower case to upper case completely changes what the code is referring to.\nYou
    cannot declare variables with the exact same name, this throws an error:\n\r##REF##code,
    \nint age = 35;\nint age = 56; // Error!\n##REF##\nBut this is valid code:\n\r##REF##code, 
    \nint age = 35;\nint Age = 56; // No error\n##REF##\nIt's valid because code
    is case sensitive and they are slightly different, 'age' vs 'Age'.\nSo when writing
    code always pay very close attention to how you write code and make sure you
    are writing the capitalization perfectly. \nThis is the number one mistake that
    beginners make so remember that."
