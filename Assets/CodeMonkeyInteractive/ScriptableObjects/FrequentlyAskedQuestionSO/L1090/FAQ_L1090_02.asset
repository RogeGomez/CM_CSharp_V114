  title: Why are data types important?
  text: 'Each variable needs to have a data type, that data type defines what type
    of data we can store inside that variable.

    There are data types for storing
    numbers, and if you define a variable of that type then you cannot store a string
    of text inside that variable.

    You always need to use the correct data type
    for whatever data you''re trying to store.

    The next lecture covers Data
    Types in detail.
