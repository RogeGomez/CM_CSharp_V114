  title: What exactly is a variable?
  text: 'A variable is a container for data. Think of it as a box and inside that
    box you can place some value.

    Then you can write code that uses a variable
    instead of a value, and by doing so when the code executes it will go inside
    that variable to grab the currently stored value and continue running the logic
    using that value.

    This also means you can have different behaviour depending
    on the value stored in the variable.

    The simplest example is just a Player
    object with some movement code. Instead of writing the movement speed directly
    you can define a variable and by modifying the value stored inside that variable
    you modify how fast/slow the player moves.
