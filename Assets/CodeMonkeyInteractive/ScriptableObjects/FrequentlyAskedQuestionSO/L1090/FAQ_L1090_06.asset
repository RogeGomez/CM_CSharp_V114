  title: What are the various ways to increment a variable?
  text: 'All of these lines of code are doing the exact same thing, incrementing
    a variable by one:

    ##REF##code, age = age + 1;

    age += 1;

    age++;##REF##

    These
    are just shorthands, the last one is especially useful when working with ''for''
    Loops which we will learn about in a future lecture.
