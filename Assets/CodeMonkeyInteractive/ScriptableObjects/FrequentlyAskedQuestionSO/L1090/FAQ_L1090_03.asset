  title: What is a good name for a variable?
  text: "A good name is something that describes exactly what that variable represents.
    Ideally just by reading the variable name you should be able to understand what
    it represents and how it might be used.\r\nFor example, '<i>moveSpeed</i>' is
    a good variable name, it clearly communicates that this variable is used as some
    kind of movement speed.\r\nA bad name would be '<i>x</i>', just by reading it
    you have no idea what it represents. \r\n(unless you're making some math equation
    and x really is the correct name for that element)\r\nYou should also avoid abbreviations
    and acronyms, those might be perfectly clear to one person and very confusing
    to someone else.\r\nThere is a very important lecture later on in the course
    all about Naming rules and how to choose good names.\r\n"
