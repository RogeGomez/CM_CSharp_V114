  title: What happens if I write 'Int' instead of 'int'?
  text: 'You get an error because there is no such type named ''Int''

    Always
    remember that code is case sensitive, the compiler doesn''t know English so as
    far as the compiler is concerned ''Int'' and ''int'' are two completely separate
    types with no relation between them.

    Whenever you get an error the first
    thing you should check is if you''re writing the code absolutely perfectly. Pay
    very close attention to capitalization, this is something a lot of beginners
    mistake.
