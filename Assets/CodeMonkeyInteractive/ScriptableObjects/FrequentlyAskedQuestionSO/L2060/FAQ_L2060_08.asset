  title: What are jagged arrays?
  text: 'They are arrays of arrays int[][] where the inner arrays have different
    lengths.

    For example index 0 would have an int[10] but then index 1 would
    have an int[5] and so on.

    As opposed to multidimensional arrays [,] or
    arrays of arrays where the size is fixed for all elements of each dimension.
