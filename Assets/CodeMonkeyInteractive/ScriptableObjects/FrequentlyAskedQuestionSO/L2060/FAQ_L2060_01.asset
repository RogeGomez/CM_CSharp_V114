  title: What is a multidimensional array, and how is it different from a regular
    (one-dimensional) array?
  text: 'A one dimensional array, like int[] has only one dimension, whereas a multidimensional
    array, like int[,] has multiple dimensions.

    Think of a int[] as a line,
    a int[,] as a square, and a int[,,] as a cube.
