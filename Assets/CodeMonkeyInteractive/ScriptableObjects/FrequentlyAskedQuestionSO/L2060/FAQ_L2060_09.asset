  title: What is a practical example of how 2D arrays are useful?
  text: 'A good practical example is my Grid system

    The grid is represented
    with a 2D array containing all the elements.

    Then that Grid System is also
    using Generics, which are covered later on in the course, which makes it super
    versatile.

    I''ve used the same underlying Grid System in tons of interesting
    systems.
