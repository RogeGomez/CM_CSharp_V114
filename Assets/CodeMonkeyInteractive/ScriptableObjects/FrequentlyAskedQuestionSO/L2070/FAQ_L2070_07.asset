  title: What are some possible problems with nested loops?
  text: 'They can make your code really hard to understand if you go too deep.

    Usually
    2 nested loops is fine, especially for doing standard things like cycling through
    a 2D array. But if you should avoid going deeper than that if you can avoid it.

    If
    you can''t avoid it, then perhaps place some looping logic in a function and
    call that function within another loop, it might help make the code more readable.
