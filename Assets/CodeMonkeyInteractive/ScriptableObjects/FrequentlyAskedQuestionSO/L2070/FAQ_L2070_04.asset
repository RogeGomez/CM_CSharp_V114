  title: How does the scope of the variables work with nested loops?
  text: 'Variables are only accessible from child nested code blocks, not parent
    code blocks.

    If you define a variable in an outer loop, you can access
    it in a nested loop.

    If you define a variable in a nested loop, you cannot
    access it in the outer loop.

    Basically the same rules apply to any kind
    of code block. Just like a function local variable can be accessed by a nested
    if, but a variable defined in a nested if cannot be accessed outside it.
