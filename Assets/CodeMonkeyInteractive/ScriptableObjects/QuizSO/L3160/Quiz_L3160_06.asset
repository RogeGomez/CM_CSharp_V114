  question: What is a valid use case for a Span in game development?
  optionList:
  - Creating a temporary array to store sliced data.
  - Displaying items per page in an inventory system.
  - Storing data for the entire game session.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'One great use case is for some kind of pagination system in some inventory.
    You can have a function that displays the contents of an inventory based on a
    span, then by grabbing different slices of the entire inventory array you can
    show different pages.
