  question: Which of the following is a characteristic of Span in C#?
  optionList:
  - It allocates new memory for the slice it creates.
  - It does not allocate new memory for the slice it creates.
  - It can only be used with string types.
  - It automatically sorts the array it points to.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: The main benefit of Span is NOT costing extra memory, it doesn't actually
    create any objects, it's just a pointer to the original data in memory.
