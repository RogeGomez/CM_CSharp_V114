  question: Could this exact same demo be built in any other way?
  optionList:
  - No
  - Yes
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Absolutely!

    Remember how there are always many many ways to achieve
    the same result. You could have built this exact same project in a million different
    ways.

    So if you think about some way to implement something but the method
    you came up with is different from mine, that does not mean your method is wrong,
    there are multiple ways to solve any problem.
