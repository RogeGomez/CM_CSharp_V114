  question: Why does the grab logic work with an IGrabObject interface?
  optionList:
  - So only Money can be grabbed
  - So enemies take damage
  - So any object that implements the interface can be grabbed
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'The goal with writing code against an interface instead of a specific
    object type is to make it work with any class that implements that interface.

    That
    way if we want to add more grabbable items we just need to make those new classes
    implement the interface. No need to modify the already existing code that grabs
    the object.
