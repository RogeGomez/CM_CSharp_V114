  question: How are item types identified?
  optionList:
  - Through an Enum
  - String name
  - Index in an array
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'In this case item types are identified through an enum.

    However
    if you were making a Unity game then perhaps a better way would be to use Scriptable
    Objects. I didn''t use them just because I tried to focus this course mainly
    on C# itself and not any specific Unity features.
