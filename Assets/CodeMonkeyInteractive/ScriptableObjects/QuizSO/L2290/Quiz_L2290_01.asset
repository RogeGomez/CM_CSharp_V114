  question: How are interfaces used in the project?
  optionList:

  - To define Grabbable Objects, Items and Attackable objects

  answer: 'Interfaces are used to make all kinds of objects have some kind of behaviour.

    For
    example IGrabObject defines objects that can be grabbed. In order to add another
    grabbable object they only need to implement that interface and the rest of the
    code will automatically work.
