  question: How are events mainly used in this game?
  optionList:
  - To decouple the UI from the Logic classes
  - As interfaces
  - To spawn the player
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Events are mainly used to decouple the UI code from the underlying logic
    class. Doing so means that technically the game could work entirely without any
    UI which helps minimize complexity since you know for a fact the logic class
    will never directly interact with any UI element.
