  question: Which classes are singletons?
  optionList:
  - GameManager, Player and GameAssets
  - Enemy and Bomb
  - Money
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'The singleton pattern is great for anything of which there is only a single
    instance.

    So in this case, there is only ever a single Player, just one
    GameManager and just one GameAssets class.

'
