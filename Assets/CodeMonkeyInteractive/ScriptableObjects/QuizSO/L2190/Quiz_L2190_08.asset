  question: In what scenario is using delegates particularly useful?
  optionList:
  - When you need to store multiple variables of different types together.
  - For asynchronous programming and callbacks.
  - When defining properties in a class.
  - To prevent method overloading.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Delegates are excellent for asynchronous programming (meaning logic that
    does not complete immediately) and for callbacks like telling a unit to move
    somewhere and running a delegate when it reaches the target, or doing an HTTP
    request and calling a delegate when the server responds.
