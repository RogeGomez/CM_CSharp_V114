  question: What is the purpose of overriding the ToString method in a class?
  optionList:
  - To change the way objects of the class are cast to other types.
  - To provide a custom string representation of the object.
  - To enable the class to be converted to a string using the as keyword.
  - To ensure that the class meets all requirements of the interface it implements.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The base object class has a ToString(); function which can be overriden
    by any class.

    Whenever you use your object in some kind of function that
    converts it to a string, like Console.WriteLine(myObject); then it will call
    the ToString(); function to convert it into a string.

    If you don''t provide
    a custom implemention then it will just say something like NameSpace-ClassName
    but by overriding that function you can give it some more meaningful text.
