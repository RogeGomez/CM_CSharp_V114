  question: What does boxing refer to in C#?
  optionList:
  - Encapsulating a value type within a reference type to store it on the heap.
  - Converting a reference type to a value type.
  - Securing sensitive information in an object.
  - Packaging multiple objects into a single container object.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'This is how in C# the base class for any type is the object or System.Object
    class, and any type can be converted onto that type, even value types.

    Doing
    so will convert that value type onto a reference type as the boxed object will
    store a reference that points to the value data.

    There is a lecture on
    boxing in the Advanced section.
