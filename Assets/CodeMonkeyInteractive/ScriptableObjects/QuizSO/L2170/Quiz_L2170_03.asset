  question: What is the result of casting a float to an integer?
  optionList:
  - The decimal portion is rounded to the nearest whole number.
  - The operation throws an exception if the number cannot be exactly represented
    as an integer.
  - The decimal portion is truncated, and only the whole number part is retained.
  - The operation fails and returns null.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If you forcefully cast a float onto an int then the result will ignore
    anything after the decimal point. It will NOT round the value.

'
