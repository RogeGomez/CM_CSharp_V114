  question: What is the primary purpose of function extensions / extension methods
    in C#?
  optionList:
  - To modify the source code of existing classes
  - To add new methods to a class without altering its source code
  - To create new classes that inherit from existing classes
  - To override existing functions in a class
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The main goal is so you can add extra logic (functions) to a class without
    having to modify it.

    Like for example, you don''t have access to modify
    Unity''s built-in Transform class, but you can definitely make a Function Extension
    that extends the Transform class with some behaviour.
