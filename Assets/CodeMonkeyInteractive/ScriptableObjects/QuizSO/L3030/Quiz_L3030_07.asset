  question: Why might you use function extensions when working with a sealed class?
  optionList:
  - To change the function that are sealed
  - To add new properties to the sealed class
  - To add new functions to the class without altering its source code
  - To unseal the class
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'By marking a class as ''sealed'' you are forbidden to extend upon it with
    normal inheritance.

    However you can indeed use function extensions to extend
    that class with extra functions.
