  question: Which of the following statements about interfaces is TRUE?
  optionList:
  - An interface can contain static methods with implementations.
  - An interface can declare fields and auto-implemented properties.
  - A class can implement multiple interfaces.
  - Interfaces can contain constructor definitions.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'One big difference between inheritance and interfaces is how a class can
    only inherit from another class but it can implement as many interfaces as you
    want.

    Interfaces cannot actually hold any data so you cannot have fields,
    they are not actual types that can be constructed so they have no constructor
    and no static functions.
