  question: Given an IAttackable interface with a Damage function, which implementation
    allows an object to be damaged?
  optionList:
  - A class that declares IAttackable in its namespace.
  - A class that uses IAttackable as a type for one of its fields.
  - A class that implements IAttackable and provides an implementation for the Damage
    function.
  - A struct that references IAttackable in its constructor.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If you define an interface IAttackable with a Damage(); function then
    you can write code that works with that interface and calls that function which
    means that code will work with anything that implements that interface, it could
    be a Player, an Enemy, a RedBarrel, etc.
