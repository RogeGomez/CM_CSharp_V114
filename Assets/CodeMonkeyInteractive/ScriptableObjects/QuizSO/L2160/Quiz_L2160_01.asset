  question: What is the primary purpose of an interface in C#?
  optionList:
  - To define a contract that specifies the methods and properties a class must implement.
  - To create a complex type that can store multiple values of different types.
  - To enable multiple inheritance of implementation in classes.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Interfaces are like contracts where you can write code against that interface
    and that code will work on any object that implements that interface since the
    compiler will ensure any classes that implement that interface are forced to
    implement everything related to that interface.
