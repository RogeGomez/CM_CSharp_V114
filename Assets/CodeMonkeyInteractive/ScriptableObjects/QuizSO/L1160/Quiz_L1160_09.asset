  question: Which C# collection type allows elements to be added or removed dynamically?
  optionList:
  - Array
  - Tuple
  - List
  - Enum
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'List is the collection that can easily grow and shrink.

    However
    there are other dynamic collections like Dictionary, HashSet, SortedList, which
    we will cover in lectures in the Intermediate section.

    Enums are also covered
    in the Intermediate section, and Tuples are covered in the Advanced section.
