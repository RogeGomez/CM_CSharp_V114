  question: What is a key difference between an array and a List?
  optionList:
  - An array can store values of different types, while a List cannot.
  - An array has a fixed size, while a List can change size dynamically.
  - A List can only store integer values, while an array can store any type.
  - An array is faster and more efficient than a List.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The main difference is how Arrays have a fixed size whereas Lists can
    have a dynamic size, they can shrink and grow after being created.

    However
    the fourth option is also true, Arrays are usually faster and more efficient
    than Lists so they are a good option when extreme performance is required.
