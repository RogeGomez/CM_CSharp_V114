  question: What is an array in C#?
  optionList:
  - A variable that can store multiple values of different data types.
  - A collection of elements of the same data type with a fixed size.
  - A function that returns multiple values.
  - A data type that automatically adjusts its size.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Arrays are a data structure that can hold multiple pieces of data of the
    same type.

    They can only store the data type they are defined with, and
    arrays have a fixed size which cannot change.

    ##REF##code,

    int[] intArray
    = new int[5]; // This array can only store ints and it has a fixed size of 5

    string[]
    stringArray = new string[7]; // This array can only store strings and it has
    a fixed size of 7

    ##REF##'
