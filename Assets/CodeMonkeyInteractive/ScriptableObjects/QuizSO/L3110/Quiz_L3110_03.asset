  question: What will happen if you use the null conditional operator with an array
    or list that is null?
  optionList:
  - The program will throw an IndexOutOfRangeException.
  - The program will compile but fail to execute.
  - The operation will be safely skipped without an exception.
  - The operation will return true.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Either the ?. or the ?[] operators will test the left side if it is null
    before doing anything.

    So this code:

    ##REF##code,

    enemyList?[0].TakeDamage();

    ##REF##

    Will
    not throw an error if ''enemyList'' is null.

    However if it is not null and
    does not have any elements then it will indeed throw an IndexOutOfRangeException.
