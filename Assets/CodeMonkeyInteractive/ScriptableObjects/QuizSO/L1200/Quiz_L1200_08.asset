  question: If a constructor is declared as private, what is the implication?
  optionList:
  - Instances of the class cannot be created directly from outside the class.
  - The class cannot have any public members.
  - The class can only be used as a base class.
  - The class is considered abstract and cannot be instantiated.

  answer: 'If the constructor is private then only code within that class can call
    the constructor to create an object.

    Usually this is what you do when you
    implement the Factory pattern, you make the constructor private and expose some
    public static function that constructs the object.
