  question: What does the 'private' access modifier do?
  optionList:
  - It allows access from any part of the program.
  - It restricts access to the member only within the same class.
  - It allows access only from derived classes.
  - It makes the member accessible only within the same assembly.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'By marking something as private it will only be accessible from within
    that class. A completely separate class will not be able to access that field/function.
