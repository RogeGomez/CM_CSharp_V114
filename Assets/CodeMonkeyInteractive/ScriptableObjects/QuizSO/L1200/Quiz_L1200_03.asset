  question: Why would you use the 'public' access modifier?
  optionList:
  - To hide implementation details of a class.
  - To allow access to a class member from any other part of the program.
  - To indicate that a member is a constant.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'You make something public when you want it to be accessible from anywhere
    in your code base.

    However you should avoid this as much as possible, the
    more you limit access to any part of your code base the better.

'
