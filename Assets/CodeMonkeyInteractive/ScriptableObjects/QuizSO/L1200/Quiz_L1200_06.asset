  question: What is the effect of applying the 'public' access modifier to a class?
  optionList:
  - The class can only be instantiated publicly.
  - The class and all its members become accessible from other parts of the program.
  - The class becomes static.
  - All members of the class are automatically public.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'You can access a public class from anywhere in your code base.

    Making
    a class public or private does not change the access modifier of any of its members.
