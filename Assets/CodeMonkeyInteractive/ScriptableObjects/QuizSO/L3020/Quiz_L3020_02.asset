  question: Which keyword is used to obtain the Type of a class in C#?
  optionList:
  - classof
  - typeof
  - instanceof
  - getClass
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Using this keyword you can get an object of type System.Type based on
    a certain type.

    Alternatively if you have an instance of an object, like
    ''player'' you can do player.GetType();

    There is a lecture on typeof later
    on in this advanced section.
