  question: What is a practical use of Reflection mentioned in the lecture?
  optionList:
  - Writing new code at runtime
  - Checking if classes and functions exist to validate exercises dynamically
  - Increasing runtime performance
  - Automatically writing code comments
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The way the interactive exercises in this companion project work is all
    thanks to Reflection.

    By using it I can write the validation code that
    checks for functions/classes that you need to implement yourself and write that
    validation code before those functions/classes exist.
