  question: What is the single responsibility principle?
  optionList:
  - Each class or function should perform a single, well-defined task.
  - A programmer should only be responsible for one module.
  - Each line of code should only perform one operation.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'The single responsibility principle states that something should do one
    thing and one thing only.

    So if a Player class has a TakeDamage(); function
    then all it should do is take damage. It should not be responsible for doing
    saving and loading or changing the scene to the main Menu.
