  question: What are 'magic numbers' in programming and why should they be avoided?
  optionList:
  - Numbers that have special properties in C#; they are deprecated.
  - Unexplained numbers in the code; they make the code hard to understand.
  - Large numbers; they slow down the program.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Magic numbers are numbers that show up in the code with no explanation
    that make it really hard to understand what the code is doing.

    Instead
    of adding magic numbers you should define a clearly named local variable to hold
    that value, doing so will make your code much easier to understand.
