  question: What does the DRY principle stand for in programming?
  optionList:
  - '"Don''t Repeat Yourself" - avoid duplicating code.'
  - '"Debug, Refactor, Yield" - a process for writing clean code.'
  - '"Data Relying on You" - ensuring data integrity.'
  - '"Direct Response Yield" - a method for efficient coding.'
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'It stands for Dont Repeat Yourself which aims to keep you from constantly
    copy pasting code all over the place.

    If you have some piece of code that
    you need to run in 5 different places, then instead of copy pasting you should
    just put that logic in a separate function.

    However at the same time remember
    these are just guidelines, it''s important to know the rules and important to
    know when to break them.

    Sometimes you might have some code that you call
    in 2 places and it might indeed make more sense to copy paste the code twice
    instead of making a separate function.

    Always remember the ultimate goal
    of writing good clean code, the goal is to help you as a programmer by minimizing
    complexity as much as possible. Keep that goal in mind in order to know whether
    to follow or break a rule.
