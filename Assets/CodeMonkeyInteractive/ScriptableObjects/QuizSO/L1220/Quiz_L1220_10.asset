  answer: 'Remember that code is a living thing, it is not set in stone. So if later
    on you come up with a better name for some symbol, take the time to rename it.

    Using
    modern IDEs this is usually super simple, in Visual Studio the shortcut is Ctrl
    + R + R, so it takes literally no effort.

    If you find a better name take
    some time to rename that symbol.
