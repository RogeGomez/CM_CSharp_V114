  question: Why are descriptive names important in clean code?
  optionList:
  - They help the compiler optimize the code.
  - They make the code easier to understand and maintain.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: "If your code is written with very descriptive names then reading the code
    should be as simple as reading English. \r\nCode that has good names for variables
    and functions while also having a good straightforward structure takes no effort
    to understand what it is doing, that's the goal.\r\n"
