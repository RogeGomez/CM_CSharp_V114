  question: How should functions be structured according to clean code guidelines?
  optionList:
  - Functions should be long and handle multiple tasks.
  - Functions should be under 50 lines.
  - Functions should be of medium length and not exceed 100 lines.
  - Functions should be as short as possible and perform one well-defined task.
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: 'Functions should do one thing and one thing only. And if they only do
    one thing usually they are pretty small.

    However there''s no inherent limit,
    there are some "things" where it takes 100 lines of code to do that thing, if
    so, if it''s all part of just a single "thing" then it''s perfectly fine for
    all of it to belong in one function.

    Same rules apply to classes themselves.
