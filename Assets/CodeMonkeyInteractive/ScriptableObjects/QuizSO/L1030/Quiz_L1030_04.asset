  question: Why is adding logs in your code recommended when you encounter issues?
  optionList:
  - To make your code run faster.
  - To help visualize exactly what the code is doing line by line.
  - Logs are required for the course completion certificate.
  - It automatically fixes the code errors.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Adding various logs in your code helps you see what the code is doing
    line by line.

    Sometimes what the code is doing is not what you think it
    is doing, so adding some logs can clear up that confusion and see exactly what
    might be going wrong.

    A more advanced method is using the Debugger which
    I will cover in detail in a lecture in the Advanced section.
