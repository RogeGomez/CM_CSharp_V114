  question: How should you phrase your question when asking for help in the course
    comments?
  optionList:
  - '"It''s not working."'
  - '"Why does this happen?"'
  - Be very specific about the issue, including any compile errors or expected vs
    actual results
  - '"Please fix this for me."'
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If something goes wrong and you need help go ahead and post in the comments
    and I''ll do my best to help.

    But in order for me to help I need to have
    enough information, there''s not much I can do with just "It''s not working"
    so be as specific and detailed as possible about what exactly isn''t working
    as you expect.
