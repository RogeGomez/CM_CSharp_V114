  optionList:
  - To set initial values for class fields.
  - To define the size of the class.

  - To override methods of the class.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: "One common use is for the constructor to receive the data the class needs
    to work and store that data in class fields which will persist that data instead
    of being lost when the constructor ends.\n##REF##code,\r\npublic class Player
    {\r\n    private string playerName;\r\n    public Player(string playerName) {\r\n       
    this.playerName = playerName;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n##REF##"
