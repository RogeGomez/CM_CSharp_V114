  answer: "The goal of a constructor is to construct/create that object and set it
    up so it can be used.\r\nConstructors can be parameterless or have any number
    of parameters. Usually you want to receive whatever data the class object requires
    in order to function.\r\nThe constructor syntax is similar to that of a function,
    except it has to be named exactly the same as the class name and does not have
    a return type\n##REF##code,\r\npublic class Player {\r\n    public Player() {\r\n       
    // Player constructor\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n##REF##"
