  question: What is the result of defining two variables of the same class type?
  optionList:
  - They will share the same values and behavior.
  - They are completely independent instances with their own data.
  - It is not possible to have more than one instance of a class.
  - They will automatically merge into a single instance.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Separate objects/instances of one class are completely separate and have
    no inherent connection to one another.

    Each object has their own data.

    However
    you can define static data/behaviour which means it belongs to the class itself
    and not any instance of a class, I cover static in detail in a future Lecture.
