  question: What are class fields?
  optionList:
  - Variables declared outside of any methods, but within a class.
  - The parameters passed to class methods.
  - The return values of class methods.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Class fields, also sometimes called class variables, are fields/variables
    defined within a class code block which means they are accessible by any child
    code block of that class, like any function or property.

    Depending on the
    access modifier they might also be accessible from outside the class. There is
    a lecture on Access Modifiers later on in the course.
