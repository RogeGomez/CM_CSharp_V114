  question: What will happen if the #error directive is encountered during the compilation
    of a C# program?
  optionList:
  - The program will compile with warnings.
  - The compilation will stop, and an error message will be shown.
  - The line will be ignored.
  - The compiler will automatically fix the error.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: If there is an #error that is involved in the compilation (meaning it's
    not #if that is excluded) then it acts like a compile error and prevents compilation.
