  question: Which Visual Studio extension is recommended for adding more colors to
    the code?
  optionList:
  - ReSharper
  - Visual Studio IntelliCode
  - Viasfora
  - NCrunch
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'The extension I use is called Viasfora, it helps add more colors in the
    code which makes it easier to read and especially makes it easier to identify
    missing closing parenthesis or curly braces, which is a mistake that a lot of
    beginners make.

    But this is just a visual thing so technically it is not
    a requirement.
