  question: What is my preferred IDE theme mentioned in the lecture?
  optionList:
  - Dark Theme
  - Light Theme
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'I know a lot of people prefer Dark Theme but for me for some reason my
    eyes cannot handle it at all. After looking at it for more than 10 seconds my
    eyes start to hurt and I get headaches.

    So for me Light mode is the only
    way that works which is what I will be using in this course.

    But this is
    just a visual thing, so if you like Dark theme then go ahead and use it.
