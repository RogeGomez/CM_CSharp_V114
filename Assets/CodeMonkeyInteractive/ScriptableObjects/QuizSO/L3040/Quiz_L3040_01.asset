  question: What is a static constructor in C#?
  optionList:
  - A constructor that is called when an instance of the class is created.
  - A constructor that is called before any instance of the class is created or before
    any member is accessed.
  - A constructor that can have parameters and multiple instances.
  - A constructor that initializes instance fields.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The static constructor is guaranteed to run before you do anything that
    involves that class.

    So it will run before you create an object of that
    class, or even before you access a static function or field.
