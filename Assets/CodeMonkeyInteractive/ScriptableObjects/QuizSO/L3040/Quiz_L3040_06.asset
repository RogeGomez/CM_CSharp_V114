  question: How can static constructors be beneficial in a multithreaded environment?
  optionList:
  - They can be called multiple times simultaneously.
  - The .NET runtime ensures that the static constructor is executed only once.
  - They allow for multiple instances of a class to be initialized at once.
  - They prevent any instance of the class from being created.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Static constructors are thread-safe, the .NET Runtime ensures that it
    only ever runs once, regardless of how many threads try to access it at the same
    time.
