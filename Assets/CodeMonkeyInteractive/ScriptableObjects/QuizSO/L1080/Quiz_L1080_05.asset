  question: What happens if code, like MyFunction(); is placed outside of a function
    code block within a class?
  optionList:
  - It will execute before any functions.
  - It is treated as a global instruction.
  - It throws an error as you can't execute instructions there.
  - It becomes a constructor for the class.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'You cannot execute a regular instruction like calling a Function(); from
    a class code block, you need to write that code inside a function code block.

    Whenever
    you write some code make sure you are writing it in the proper place.
