  question: How does C# treat capitalization in code?
  optionList:
  - Capitalization is ignored in C#.
  - Only variable names are case-sensitive.
  - Capitalization is crucial and code is case-sensitive.
  - Capitalization matters only for class names.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'This is the most important thing you need to learn, and the main cause
    of errors for beginners.

    Code is case sensitive. The compiler cannot read
    English, it cannot tell that ''int'' and ''Int'' look similar, as far as the
    compiler knows those are two completely different symbols.

    So always always
    double check and make sure you write your code 100% properly.
