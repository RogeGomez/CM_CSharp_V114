  question: What is a nullable type?
  optionList:
  - A special reference type that can only store null values.
  - A value type modified to accept null as a valid value in addition to its usual
    data.
  - An array type that can be emptied but not set to null.
  - A struct that has been explicitly set to null.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Nullable is how you can allow any type to support null, even value types.

    You
    can define them by using the Nullable class or just adding a question mark at
    the end.

    There is a lecture on Nullable in the Advanced section.
