  question: What happens when you assign one variable of a value type to another?
  optionList:
  - The reference to the data is copied.
  - A deep copy of the object is automatically performed.
  - The data is copied directly, creating an independent copy.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'When you assign a value type to another you create a completely separate
    copy that is assigned to that other variable.

    After the assignment, the
    two variables will have no relation to one another.
