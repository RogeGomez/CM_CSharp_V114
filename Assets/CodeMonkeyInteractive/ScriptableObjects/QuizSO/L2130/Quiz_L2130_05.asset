  question: When modifying a reference type passed as a parameter to a function,
    which of the following is true?
  optionList:
  - Changes to the object will not be reflected outside the function.
  - Only a copy of the object is modified, leaving the original object unchanged.
  - The modifications affect the original object outside the function.
  - The function can only modify the object if it returns a new reference.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If you pass in a reference type to a function then the function will receive
    a reference to the original data.

    Meaning if you modify that object inside
    the function it will modify the original object itself. Therefore changes to
    that object within that function are reflected outside of it.
