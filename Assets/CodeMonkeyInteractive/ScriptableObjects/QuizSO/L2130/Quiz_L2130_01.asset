  question: What is the main difference between value types and reference types in
    C#?
  optionList:
  - Reference types can only be used within static methods, while value types can
    be used anywhere.
  - Value types store the data directly, whereas reference types store a reference
    to the data.
  - Reference types are used for simple data types like integers and booleans, while
    value types are used for complex objects.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Value types store their data directly, whereas Reference types merely
    store a reference that points to where the actual data is stored.
