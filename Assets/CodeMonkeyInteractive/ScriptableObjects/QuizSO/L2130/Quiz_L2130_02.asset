  question: Which of the following are value types in C#?
  optionList:
  - Classes
  - Structs
  - Arrays
  - Strings
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Structs are similar to classes with one big difference being how they
    are value types.

    Strings are reference types although they mostly act like
    value types. If you pass in a string onto a function it will pass in a reference.
