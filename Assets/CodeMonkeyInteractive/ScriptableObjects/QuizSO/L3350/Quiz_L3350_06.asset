  question: What is the purpose of the ThreadPool class in C#?
  optionList:
  - To manually create and manage multiple threads.
  - To create a pool of threads that can be reused for short-lived tasks.
  - To ensure that threads run in a specific order.
  - To handle exceptions in multithreaded applications.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'ThreadPool is a simple easy way to write some multithreaded code, you
    don''t have to manage keeping threads by yourself, you just pass in some code
    to the ThreadPool and it will be executed by a pool of worker threads managed
    by the .NET Runtime.
