  question: Which of the following describes a deadlock?
  optionList:
  - When two threads are waiting for each other to release a lock, causing both to
    be stuck.
  - When a thread runs longer than expected.
  - When a thread finishes execution without releasing its resources.
  - When a thread is created but never starts.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'If you have complex code that involves multiple threads and multiple locks
    you might end up in a situation where 2 threads are waiting for each other to
    release a lock. This leads to both threads waiting forever for the other one.
