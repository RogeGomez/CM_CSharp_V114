  question: What is a race condition in multithreading?
  optionList:
  - When multiple threads execute in a sequential manner.
  - When multiple threads attempt to modify shared data simultaneously, leading to
    unpredictable results.
  - When a thread finishes execution before it starts.
  - When a thread does not release its resources properly.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: When you have multiple threads reading and writing to some shared data
    you get unpredictable results because the order that the threads do work is non-deterministic.
