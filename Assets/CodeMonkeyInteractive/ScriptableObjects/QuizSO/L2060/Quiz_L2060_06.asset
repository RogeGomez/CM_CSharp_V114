  question: What is the default value of an uninitialized element in a 2D array of
    integers?
  optionList:
  - null
  - 0
  - 1
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The default value for all elements of an array will be the zero equivalent
    value for that type.

    So for value types like int the default is 0, for
    bool it''s false, and for reference types like a custom Player type is null

    There
    is a lecture on the difference between Value and Reference Types later on in
    the course.
