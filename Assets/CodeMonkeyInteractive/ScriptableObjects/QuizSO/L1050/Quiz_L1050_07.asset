  question: What is the purpose of the Update function in a Unity script?
  optionList:
  - To run once when the game starts
  - To run once every minute
  - To execute code every frame of the game
  - To update Unity to the latest version
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'The Update() function runs once every single frame.

    Since it is
    tied to framerate it means that if your game is running at 60FPS then the Update()
    function will run 60 times per second, and if you''re running at 30FPS it will
    run 30 times.
