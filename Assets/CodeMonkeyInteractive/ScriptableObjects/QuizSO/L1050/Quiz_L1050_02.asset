  question: Which version of Unity is recommended that you use?
  optionList:
  - The oldest available version
  - The latest LTS version
  - Any version that supports JavaScript
  - The version that requires a license
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'You should always use the latest LTS version, it is the most stable and
    up to date. You shouldn''t use the Alpha or Beta versions unless you''re testing
    something on the bleeding edge.

    However in this course you should use the
    version that is used in the course project. So just add the project to Unity
    Hub and you should see a button to download that exact version.
