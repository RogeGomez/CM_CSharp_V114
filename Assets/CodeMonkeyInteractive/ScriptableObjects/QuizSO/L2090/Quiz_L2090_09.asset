  question: In Unity, why might you use a custom class and a List to serialize Dictionary
    data for the editor?
  optionList:
  - Because Dictionaries cannot be directly serialized and shown in the Unity Editor.
  - To improve the performance of Dictionary operations in game scripts.
  - Because using Lists is more memory-efficient than using Dictionaries.
  - To automatically sort the elements in the Dictionary.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Unity doesn''t support serializing dictionaries by default, meaning they
    will not show up in the inspector.

    The workaround is to make a class that
    has the key value pair you want, then expose a list of that class, and on Awake();
    just initialize the dictionary using that data.
