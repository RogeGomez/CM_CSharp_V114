  question: How do you correctly initialize a for loop to iterate three times?
  optionList:
  - for (int i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
  - for (int i = 1; i < 3; i++)
  - for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
  - for (int i = 0; i < 3; i+=2)
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'You initialize the iterator at 0, then test the condition under 3, it''s
    very important that you don''t mistake < for <=, one of the most common beginner
    programming errors are off by one errors, usually related to the wrong comparison
    sign.

    And finally increase by one, although you can increase by any amount
    you wish.
