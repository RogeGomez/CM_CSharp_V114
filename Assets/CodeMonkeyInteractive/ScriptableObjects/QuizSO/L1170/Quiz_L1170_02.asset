  question: Which C# loop checks its condition after executing the code block?
  optionList:
  - do-while loop
  - foreach loop
  - while loop
  - for loop
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'The do while loop only tests the condition at the very end, so it is guaranteed
    to always run the code inside the loop at least once.

    Whereas all the other
    loop types, they all test the condition at the beginning and will never run the
    loop if the condition is false.
