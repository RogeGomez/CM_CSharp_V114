  question: What is the result of an infinite loop in a program?
  optionList:
  - The program will crash immediately.
  - The loop will stop automatically after a set number of iterations.
  - The loop will execute continuously until the program is forcibly stopped.
  - The loop will execute a few times and then stop.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'An infinite loop will run infinitely.

    On a console app this means
    it will run forever until you stop it, either you close the window or press Ctrl
    + C

    In Unity, the game will be frozen while the infinite loop runs and
    the only way to get out is to force quit which may imply loss of data so save
    often and pay close attention to your loops!
