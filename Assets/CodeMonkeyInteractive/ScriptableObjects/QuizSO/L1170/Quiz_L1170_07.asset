  question: What is the function of the i++ in a for loop like for (int i = 0; i
    < 3; i++)?
  optionList:
  - It checks the loop's condition.
  - It initializes the loop variable.
  - It increments the loop variable by 1 in each iteration.
  - It determines the loop's execution speed.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'The last part of the for is usually used for the incrementer where you
    usually increase the iterator variable by one.

    However this is not required,
    you can increment by any amount you want, you can decrement, multiply, etc.

    You
    can actually even write any code within that part and do custom logic at the
    end of each loop iteration.

    ##REF##code,

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++,
    Console.WriteLine("asdf"));

    ##REF##

    However this looks pretty messy
    so while it is technically possible you really should never do this.
