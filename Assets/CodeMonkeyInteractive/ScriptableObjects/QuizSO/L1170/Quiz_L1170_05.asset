  question: What will happen if you try to modify the collection being iterated over
    in a foreach loop?
  optionList:
  - The loop will adapt to the changes in the collection.
  - The program will throw a runtime exception.
  - The changes will be ignored until the loop completes.
  - The loop will restart from the beginning.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'If you modify a collection while doing a foreach through it, you get an
    exception "Collection was modified"

    If you need to do this then consider
    making a copy of the collection and iterating through that one, or using a regular
    for loop.
