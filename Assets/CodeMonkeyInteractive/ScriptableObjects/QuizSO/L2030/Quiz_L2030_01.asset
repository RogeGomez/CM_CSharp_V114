  answer: 'Refactoring simply means rewriting or reorganizing your code to make it
    more understandable and easy to read.

    Remember that your code is a living
    thing, so as you write more and more code remember that it''s perfectly okay
    to refactor if you come up with a better way to do something or just a better
    name for some symbol.
