  question: What mindset is encouraged for beginners transitioning to intermediate
    programmers?
  optionList:
  - Striving for perfection in the first code draft.
  - Understanding that code rewriting is a normal and essential part of development.
  - Avoiding refactoring to save time.
  - Writing code that never needs to be reviewed or changed.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'If you''re going from beginner to intermediate then it is absolutely crucial
    for you to understand that rewriting code is a perfectly normal part of the process.

    Even
    the most experienced coders don''t write everything perfect the first time.

    Refactoring
    is meant to be a constant activity, you''re always meant to be analyzing your
    own code to see if something could be done in a better way. And if you do come
    up with a better way then take some time to refactor that code.
