  optionList:
  - Changing variable names for better clarity.
  - Splitting a multifunctional function into multiple smaller functions.
  - Combining separate data into a custom class.
  - All of the above.
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: 'All of these are part of the refactoring process.

    Try to see if

    Try to see if some logic would make
    more sense in a separate function.

    Try to see if a some data that is linked
    would be better in it''s own class.
