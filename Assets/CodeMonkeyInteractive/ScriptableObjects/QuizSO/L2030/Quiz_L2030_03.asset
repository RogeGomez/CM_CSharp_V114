  question: What is the first goal when building a new system, such as a health system,
    in your game or program?
  optionList:
  - To ensure the system is scalable.
  - To make the system as complex as possible.
  - To get the system working.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Your first goal should be to get the system working.

    not expected to be perfect on the first try. As long as it works then afterwards
    you can refactor that code to make it more readable and understandable.
