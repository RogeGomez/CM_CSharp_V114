  question: Why is it okay to write "semi-dirty" code on the first attempt?
  optionList:
  - Because clean code is not necessary for small projects.
  - Because initial focus should be on functionality rather than cleanliness.
  - Because users cannot see the code quality.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Your primary purpose at first should be to get the system working. Once
    it''s working then you can clean it up.

    However I would advise you to at
    least take some care with your first try, don''t make it intentionally dirty.
    Try to use good practices and follow clean code guidelines.
