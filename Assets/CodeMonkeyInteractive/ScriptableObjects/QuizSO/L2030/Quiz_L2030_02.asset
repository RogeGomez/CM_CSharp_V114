  question: Which of the following best describes the attitude toward code?
  optionList:
  - Code is static and should not be changed once it works.
  - Code is a living thing that constantly evolves as the project develops.
  - Code perfection is achievable on the first try with enough experience.

  answer: 'As long as you''re working on a project it is perfectly normal to keep
    rewriting parts of that project.

    If you come up with a better way to do
    something then go rewrite that code. Don''t be afraid to change something that
    is already written.
