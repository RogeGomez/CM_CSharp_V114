  question: What does the error 'requires an instance of a class' imply when trying
    to access a class member?
  optionList:
  - The member is private and cannot be accessed.
  - The member is static and should be accessed through the class.
  - An instance of the class is needed to access a non-static member.
  - The class does not exist.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'This error usually happens when beginners try to access a function through
    the class name instead of an object of that type.

    Later on there is a lecture
    on Static and what that means.
