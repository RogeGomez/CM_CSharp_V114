  answer: 'This is the most common error you''re going to encounter, it is very common
    for both beginners and advanced users.

    It simply means you are trying to
    access something on some object that is currently set to null.

    The solution
    will depend on what exactly you''re trying to do, I covered my 4 step process
    in a video
