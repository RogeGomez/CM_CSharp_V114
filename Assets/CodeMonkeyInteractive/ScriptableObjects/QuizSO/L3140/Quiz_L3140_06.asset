  question: What happens if multiple classes in a C# project contain a Main function?
  optionList:
  - The compiler automatically selects the most appropriate Main function.
  - An error occurs due to multiple entry points.
  - All Main functions are executed in the order they are compiled.
  - The Main function in the first file is used as the entry point.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: If you define multiple static Main functions in different classes then
    you get a compiler error and you need to specify in the project properties which
    one should be the entry point.
