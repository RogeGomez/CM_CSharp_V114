  question: What is the purpose of the Nullable type in C#?
  optionList:
  - To ensure that all types can be set to zero.
  - To allow value types, such as int and bool, to accept null values.
  - To convert reference types to value types.
  - To increase memory efficiency for value types.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'By making something a Nullable you are allowing it to support a null value,
    even things like int''s and bool''s.

    This can be a great way to define
    "no value" instead of defining something like "-1"
