  question: What additional method can be used as a fallback if the Dispose method
    is not called?
  optionList:
  - Initialize
  - CleanUp
  - Class Destructor
  - Finalize
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: As a fallback you can use the class destructor to call Dispose(); which
    will run when the object is destroyed by garbage collection.
