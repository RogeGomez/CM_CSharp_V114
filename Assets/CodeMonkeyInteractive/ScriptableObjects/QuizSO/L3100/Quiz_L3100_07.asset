  question: What must be done to use records in Unity, considering its current C#
    version limitations?
  optionList:
  - Records cannot be used in Unity at all.
  - A special namespace and an empty class must be defined as a workaround.

  answer: "You need to explicitly define the class IsExternalInit and place it in
    the namespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices\r\nIt does not need to have any
    data or functions, it just needs to exist.\n##REF##code,\r\nnamespace System.Runtime.CompilerServices
    {\r\n\tpublic class IsExternalInit {\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n##REF##"
