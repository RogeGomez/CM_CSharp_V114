  question: If a record is declared as mutable, what must be included in its property
    definition?
  optionList:
  - A get and set accessor must be explicitly defined in the properties.
  - It must be marked with the mutable keyword.
  - It must include an explicit constructor.
  - A static constructor must be used.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: "You need to explicitly define the property with the accessors you want,
    in order to make it mutable it needs a set;\r\n##REF##code,\r\npublic record
    Person(string Name) {\r\n\tpublic Name { get; set; } = Name;\r\n}\n##REF##"
