  question: Is it a good practice to use single-letter variable names in C#?
  optionList:
  - Yes, for all variables.
  - Only for iterator variables in loops.
  - No, absolutely never.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Single letter variable names should be avoided because you can''t really
    describe anything with just one letter.

    The common exception are iterator
    variables where it is very common to use i, j, k, l

    These are okay to use
    within their loops because their use case is easily understood.
