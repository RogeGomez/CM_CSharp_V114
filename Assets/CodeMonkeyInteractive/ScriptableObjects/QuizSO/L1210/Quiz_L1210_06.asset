  answer: "Refactoring is a perfectly normal, and extremely important part of programming.
    You should absolutely refactor your code any time you come up with a better way
    of achieving the same result.\r\nThis is something that beginners need to learn,
    usually they think once the code is written that it's done forever but that is
    not the case. Code is a living breathing thing and should adapt as your project
    grows.\r\nRefactoring is extremely important and something you must remember
    to do if you want to write better code.\r\nThere is a dedicated lecture all about
    Refactoring in the beginning of the Intermediate section. \r\n"
