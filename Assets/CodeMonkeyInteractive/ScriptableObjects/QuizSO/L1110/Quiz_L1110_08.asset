  question: "What is the result of the following code snippet?\r\nint num = 10;\r\nif
    (num > 5 && num < 15) {\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"In range\");\r\n} else\r\n{\r\n   
    Console.WriteLine(\"Out of range\");\r\n}\r\n"
  optionList:
  - Prints "In range"
  - Prints "Out of range"
  - Nothing is printed
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Since num is set to 10 which is indeed bigger than 5 and smaller than
    15 then both conditions are true which evaluates the combined AND to true which
    runs the code inside it.
