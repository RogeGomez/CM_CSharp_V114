  question: Do you need to write a code block if you just have a single instruction
    inside the if?
  optionList:
  - Yes, the code block if always required.
  - No
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'A code block is not required. If you don''t add one then the very next
    instruction after the if will be considered as part of the if and will run when
    the condition is true.

    However while this is the case you should ALWAYS
    write a code block to avoid any issues where later on you want to add one more
    instruction to your if but don''t add the code block which in turn breaks all
    your code.
