  question: How can you exit an outer loop from within an inner loop?
  optionList:
  - Use the break statement directly in the inner loop.
  - Set a boolean flag in the inner loop and check it in the outer loop to decide
    whether to break.
  - Use the continue statement in the inner loop.
  - Nested loops do not allow exiting the outer loop from the inner loop.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Since you cannot exit an outer loop by just calling break; on an inner
    loop, what you can do is set some boolean value in the inner loop and on the
    outer one you check that boolean to decide whether to break; the outer loop or
    not.
