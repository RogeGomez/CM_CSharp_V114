  question: How does the execution order of nested loops work?
  optionList:
  - The inner loop completes all its iterations before the outer loop continues.
  - The outer loop completes one iteration and then the inner loop starts from the
    beginning.
  - Both loops run simultaneously.
  - The outer loop waits for the inner loop to complete all iterations before it
    starts.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'For every iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will run all its
    iterations.
