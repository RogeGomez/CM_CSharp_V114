  question: What is the effect of the continue keyword in a nested loop?
  optionList:
  - It skips the rest of the code in the current loop and starts the next iteration
    of both loops.
  - It immediately exits all loops and resumes execution after the loops.
  - It skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the innermost loop
    and proceeds to the next iteration.
  - It resets the iterator of the current loop to its initial value.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'The continue; keyword will immediately send that loop to the next iteration
    and not execute any code after the continue.

    However, just like break,
    it only affects the loop where it''s used, it does not affect any parent loops.
