  question: Why is caution advised when using deeply nested loops?
  optionList:
  - Because they can significantly slow down program execution.
  - Because they can quickly become difficult to read and maintain.
  - Because they are deprecated in modern programming languages.
  - Because they can only loop a finite number of times before causing an error.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Nested loops have no limit, in theory you can nest 100 levels deep and
    it will work fine.

    However the more you nest the harder it becomes to understand
    what the code is doing, so in most cases you should only go about 2 levels deep.
