  question: What is the standard convention for naming iterator variables in nested
    loops?
  optionList:
  - Always use x and y for any depth of nesting.
  - Use i, followed by j, and then k, l, m for further nesting.
  - Use a, b, c sequentially regardless of nesting depth.
  - Naming conventions are arbitrary and have no standard pattern.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The general convention is to use i, j then it needed k, l, m.

    However
    it''s just a convention, you can name your iterator variable whatever you want.
    It could be something more descriptive like playerIndex;
