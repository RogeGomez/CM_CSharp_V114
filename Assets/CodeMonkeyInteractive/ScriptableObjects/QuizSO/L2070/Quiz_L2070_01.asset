  question: What is a nested loop in programming?
  optionList:
  - A loop that can only execute a fixed number of times.
  - A loop that runs within another loop.
  - A special type of loop used only in array operations.
  - A loop that automatically ends when a condition is met.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Nested loops are loops that are nested within other loops.

    This
    lets you have more control over how many iterations of your loop run. For every
    iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will run all its iterations.
