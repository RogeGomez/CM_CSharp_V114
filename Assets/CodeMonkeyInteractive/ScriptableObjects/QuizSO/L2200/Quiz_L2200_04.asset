  question: 'When would it be more appropriate to use a local function instead of
    a lambda expression '
  optionList:
  - When the function needs to be named and possibly reused within the enclosing
    method.
  - When the function is simple and used immediately within its scope, particularly
    for passing as an argument to a method.
  - When you need to define a function that will be used across multiple classes.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'The main benefit of local functions is defining a name so they are great
    when you want to run that logic multiple times. If you use a lambda you need
    to store it in a delegate variable in order to reuse it.
