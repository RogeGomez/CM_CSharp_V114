  question: What is the main advantage of using local functions over lambdas?
  optionList:
  - Local functions can capture and modify external variables without limitations.
  - Local functions are more memory-efficient because they are defined at compile-time
    and do not create objects at runtime.
  - Local functions can be passed as parameters to other methods.
  - Local functions can be invoked asynchronously.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Since local functions are defined at compile time they are more memory
    efficient than lambdas, which require creating objects at runtime.
