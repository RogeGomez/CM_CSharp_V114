  question: How do local functions differ from lambda expressions?
  optionList:
  - Local functions can only be defined within classes, whereas lambdas can be defined
    anywhere.
  - Local functions are compiled at runtime, while lambdas are compiled at compile-time.
  - Local functions are defined within the scope of another function and have a name,
    whereas lambdas are anonymous.
  - Lambdas can return values, but local functions cannot.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: Local functions are defined within another function and they can have a
    name. They are also defined at compile time allowing them to be used in the function
    before they are declared.
