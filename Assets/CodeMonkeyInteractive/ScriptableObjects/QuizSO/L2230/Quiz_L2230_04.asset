  question: Which statement is true regarding readonly fields?
  optionList:
  - They can only be primitive data types.
  - They can store instances of custom classes and are initialized at runtime.
  - They cannot be used within constructors.
  - They become constants once a program is compiled.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'If a field is defined at readonly then it can have data defined at runtime,
    it just needs the value to be defined either in the definition itself or in the
    class constructor.
