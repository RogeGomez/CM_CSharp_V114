  question: How does the readonly keyword differ from const?
  optionList:
  - readonly variables can have their values changed at runtime.
  - readonly variables must be static.
  - readonly variables can be set during runtime, but only once either at declaration
    or in a class constructor.
  - readonly variables are evaluated at compile-time.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Constants have to have their value defined at compile time, whereas readonly
    can have it''s value set at runtime, either in the definition itself or the class
    constructor.

    After being defined the value cannot change.

    Readonly
    fields can also be static or non-static.
