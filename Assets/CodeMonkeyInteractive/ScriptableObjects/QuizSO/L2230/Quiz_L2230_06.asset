  question: Why might you use a readonly field instead of a const?
  optionList:
  - When you need the field to change values multiple times.
  - When the field's value is known only at runtime and it should not change after
    the class instance is constructed.
  - When you need to ensure the field value is evaluated at compile-time.
  - When the field needs to hold an array or collection.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Readonly is great for when you want a constant value but the type can
    only be created at runtime.
