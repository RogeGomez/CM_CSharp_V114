  question: What does Task.Delay(3000) do in an asynchronous context?
  optionList:
  - Blocks the main thread for 3 seconds.
  - Executes code for 3 seconds.
  - Pauses the asynchronous function for 3 seconds without blocking the main thread.
  - Cancels the task if it takes more than 3 seconds.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: This simply pauses the async function for 3 seconds, while paused the control
    will return to the main thread that continues executing as normal.
