  question: What does the await keyword do in an asynchronous function?
  optionList:
  - It blocks the main thread until the task completes.
  - It pauses the execution of the function until the awaited task completes.
  - It runs the function on a separate thread.
  - It cancels the task if it takes too long.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'When the code reaches an await statement, it starts executing it, and
    then immediately returns control back to the calling function. Then periodically
    it checks the state of that piece of code to see if it has completed.
