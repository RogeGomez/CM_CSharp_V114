  question: Which of the following statements about asynchronous programming in C#
    is true?
  optionList:
  - Asynchronous programming is always multithreaded.
  - Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run in parallel without blocking the
    main thread, but it does not mean multithreading.
  - Asynchronous programming blocks the main thread until all tasks are complete.
  - Asynchronous programming is slower than synchronous programming.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Async is a great way to keep your program responsive while doing other
    tasks, but it does NOT make your program multithreaded by default. Although it
    can be combined with multithreading.
