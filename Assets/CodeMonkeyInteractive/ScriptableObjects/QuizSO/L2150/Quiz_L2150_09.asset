  question: What is one major guideline to remember when using inheritance in C#?
  optionList:
  - Inheritance should be used in all classes to ensure code reusability.
  - Prefer composition over inheritance to avoid complexity and ensure code flexibility.
  - All classes should inherit from at least one other class.
  - Inheritance is deprecated in the latest versions of C# and should be avoided.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Ineritance is a powerful tool that has its use cases however it can also
    be very easy to abuse and end up with really confusing code.

    So in general
    you should prefer composition over inheritance, meaning instead of having a complex
    web of base classes and derived classes, you should have your objects composed
    of various individual separate parts.
