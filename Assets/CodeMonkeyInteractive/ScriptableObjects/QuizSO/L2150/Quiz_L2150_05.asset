  question: Which of the following is true about abstract classes?
  optionList:
  - They can be instantiated directly using the new keyword.
  - They must be derived from another abstract class.
  - They cannot be instantiated directly and can contain abstract methods that must
    be implemented by derived classes.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If a class is marked as Abstract then you cannot create instances of that
    type, only classes that extend that abstract class.

    Also abstract methods
    must be implemented in derived classes.
