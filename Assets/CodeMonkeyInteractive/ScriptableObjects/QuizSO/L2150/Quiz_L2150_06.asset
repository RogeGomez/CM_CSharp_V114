  question: What is the purpose of the override keyword?
  optionList:
  - To change the value of a base class field in a derived class.
  - To indicate that a function replaces the implementation of a base class function.
  - To mark a function in a base class that cannot be overridden.
  - To explicitly call a function from the base class in a derived class.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'In order for a function to have a different implementation in a derived
    class than a base class then the base class needs to mark that function as virtual
    and the derived class can re-define it with override.
