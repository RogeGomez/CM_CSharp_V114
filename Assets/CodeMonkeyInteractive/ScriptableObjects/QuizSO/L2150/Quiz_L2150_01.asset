  question: What is inheritance in the context of C# classes?
  optionList:
  - Copying properties from one class to another.
  - A class taking on the properties, methods, and fields of another class.
  - A method of selectively hiding methods in a base class.
  - Converting one class type to another.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'You can make a class inherit from a base class which will mean that class
    contains all the behaviour and data of that base class and on top of it can have
    more data and logic or override certain logic in the base class.
