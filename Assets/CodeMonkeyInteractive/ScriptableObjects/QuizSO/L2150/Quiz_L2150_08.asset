  question: What is an abstract function in C#?
  optionList:
  - A function that provides a complete implementation that can optionally be overridden.
  - A function that must be implemented by any non-abstract class that derives from
    the class containing the abstract function.
  - A static function that cannot be instantiated.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'When you define a function as abstract then any derived classes have to
    provide an implementation for that function.
