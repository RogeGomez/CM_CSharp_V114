  question: What does the protected access modifier do?
  optionList:
  - It allows access to the class member from any class in the application.
  - It restricts access to the class member to only the class that defines it.
  - It allows access to the class member from the defining class and any derived
    classes.
  - It prevents the class member from being overridden in any derived class.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'protected means only the class that defines it any any classes that extend
    that class can access it.

    This is what you want to use when you want to
    make something private but also accessible by any derived classes.
