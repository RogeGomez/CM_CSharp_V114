  question: What limitation do structs have compared to classes in terms of type
    hierarchy?
  optionList:
  - Structs can implement multiple interfaces.
  - Structs cannot inherit from other structs or classes, but can implement interfaces.
  - Structs can inherit from one class and multiple interfaces.
  - There are no limitations; structs and classes can be used interchangeably in
    hierarchies.
