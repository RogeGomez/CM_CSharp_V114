  question: In the context of structs, what does immutability mean?
  optionList:
  - The struct cannot be instantiated once defined.
  - Once a struct is instantiated, its fields shoult not be changed.
  - Structs cannot be null and thus are always in a valid state.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Structs are usually immutable, meaning that after their data is defined
    they should not change.

    However this is not a compiler rule, you can indeed
    modify structs after creating them. This is just a nice guideline to follow to
    keep your code simpler.
