  question: Why might structs be more memory efficient than classes?
  optionList:
  - Because they are always stored on the heap.
  - Because they are stored on the stack, leading to more efficient memory access.
  - Because they cannot contain as much data as classes, thus using less memory.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Structs are usually stored in the stack (unless they are huge or hold
    reference types) and working with the stack is more memory efficient than the
    heap.
