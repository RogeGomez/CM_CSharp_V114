  question: Can a function access a variable defined in another function directly?
  optionList:
  - Yes, always.
  - Only if the variable is declared as global.
  - No, functions can't access each other's local variables.
  - Yes, but only if both functions are static.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Local variables defined within a function are local to that function and
    are inaccessible from any other separate function.

    Technically you can
    define Lambda Anonymous functions inside a function which can access local variables,
    but that''s a more advanced topic that I cover in the lecture on Delegates in
    the Intermediate section.
