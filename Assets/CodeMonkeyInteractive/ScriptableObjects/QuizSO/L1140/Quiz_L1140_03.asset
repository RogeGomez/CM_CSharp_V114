  question: If a variable is defined inside an if statement, where can it be accessed?
  optionList:
  - Anywhere in the program.
  - Inside the if statement and in all nested code blocks within it.
  - Outside the if statement, but within the same function.
  - Only in other if statements.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'If you define a variable inside an if then only code within that if, and
    any nested code blocks, can access it.

    Parent code blocks or completely
    separate code blocks do not have access to that variable.
