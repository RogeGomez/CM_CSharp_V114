  question: What is a class variable in C#?
  optionList:
  - A variable that can be used in any part of the program.
  - A variable defined in a class code block.
  - A variable that defines the properties of a class.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Class variables (also known as fields) are defined within a class code
    block and as such are accessible from any function defined within that class.

    Although
    in this case they can also be accessed outside it if the variable is marked as
    public.

    I cover Classes and Access Modifiers in detail in future lectures.
