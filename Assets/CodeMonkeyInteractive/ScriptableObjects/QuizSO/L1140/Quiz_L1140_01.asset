  question: What is 'scope' in the context of C# programming?
  optionList:
  - The range of values a variable can hold.
  - The part of the code where a variable or function is accessible.
  - The memory allocation size for a variable.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Scope is what refers to the accessibility of some symbol like a variable
    or a function.

    Another way to think about it is how it refers to the lifetime
    of that variable.

    If you define a local variable inside a function, as
    soon as that function is done the local variable is gone.

    Pay attention
    to the code blocks, you can access symbols defined in parent code blocks but
    not child code blocks.
