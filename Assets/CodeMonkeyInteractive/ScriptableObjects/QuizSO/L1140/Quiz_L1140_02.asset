  question: What happens to a local variable defined within a function when the function
    execution is complete?
  optionList:
  - It remains in memory and can be accessed by other functions.
  - It becomes a global variable.
  - It is destroyed and cannot be accessed outside the function.
  - It retains its value for the next function call.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'As soon as a function ends all the variables local to that function are
    disposed of and can no longer be accessed.

    Parameters count as local variables.

    Although
    there is a difference between Value Types and Reference Types, I cover that in
    detail in a lecture in the Intermediate section.
