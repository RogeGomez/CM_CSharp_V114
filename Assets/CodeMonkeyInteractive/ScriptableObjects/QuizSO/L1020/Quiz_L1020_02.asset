  answer: "Back in the late 90's Microsoft wanted to build upon Java but the company
    behind it, Sun, did not want Microsoft to do that. Therefore Microsoft decided
    to build their own language which became C#. \r\nThis is why it is so similar
    to Java, if you know Java you will quickly pick up C#.\r\n"
