  question: What problem does the Command Pattern primarily address?
  optionList:
  - Ensuring that a class can only have one instance.
  - Managing requests, queuing, logging, and undoable operations.
  - Organizing objects into specific categories for easy retrieval.
  - Allowing objects to communicate without knowing each other's identity.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The Command pattern is really just clever use of delegates. You store
    all the logic inside some abstraction, like a simple delegate, and then execute
    that delegate when needed.

    The class executing the command does not need
    to know all the specifics about what the command will do.
