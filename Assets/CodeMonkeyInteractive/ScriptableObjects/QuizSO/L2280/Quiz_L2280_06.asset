  question: Which pattern is particularly useful for managing resources in game development
    to minimize the overhead of creating and destroying objects frequently?
  optionList:
  - Adapter Pattern
  - Singleton Pattern
  - Object Pool Pattern
  - Dependency Injection Pattern
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: "Object Pooling is one of the best ways of making your games much more
    performant. \r\nIf you have something like a Bullet hell shooter then the game
    will be almost unplayable if you're constantly spawning and destroying thousands
    of bullets.\r\nBy using an object pool, which means reusing objects, you will
    get a massive performance boost.\r\n"
