  question: What is the primary benefit of using the Adapter (Wrapper) Pattern?
  optionList:
  - It allows for the dynamic allocation of object responsibilities.
  - It simplifies complex interfaces or classes from third-party libraries.
  - It restricts object creation to a single point in the application.
  - It notifies dependent objects about changes in another object.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
