  question: When overriding the == operator, which method should also be overridden
    to avoid warnings?
  optionList:
  - ToString
  - Equals and GetHashCode
  - CompareTo
  - Clone
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: If you override == you should also override Equals and GetHashCode in order
    to have consistency over all equality methods.
