  answer: 'JSON is a very useful and widely used text based data format. And despite
    the name it is not just used in JavaScript.

    

    It''s human readable
    and easily editable with lots of libraries to handle it like Unity''s JsonUtility
    which makes it great for Saving and Loading data and interacting with all kinds
    of Web Services and REST APIs.

    

    I''ve used it in so many ways in
    so many videos, I made an overview video, one where I used it for Saving and
    Loading (which is how I always save data, even in my latest game Dinky Guardians),
    I''ve used it to interact with Steam workshop, Azure and tons more.'
