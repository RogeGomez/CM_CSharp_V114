  question: How can you manually iterate over a collection implementing IEnumerable?
  optionList:
  - By using a while loop and calling the MoveNext() method of IEnumerable.
  - By using a for loop and incrementing an index to access elements.
  - By calling the GetEnumerator() method on the collection and then using a while
    loop with MoveNext().
  - By directly accessing elements using their index.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'To manually iterate through an IEnumerable you get the GetEnumerator();
    and then call MoveNext(); and Current until you reach the end of the collection.

    By
    the way you can also implement index access to a custom type, there is a lecture
    on the advanced section on how to do this.
