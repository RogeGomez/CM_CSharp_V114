  question: What is a key benefit of using IEnumerable in your custom classes?
  optionList:
  - It allows your classes to be directly added to or removed from collections.
  - It enables your classes to use array syntax for element access.
  - It allows your classes to be compatible with the foreach loop and other LINQ
    operations.
  - It automatically implements sorting algorithms for your collections.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'By implementing this interface you allow your class to work with foreach
    loops and also LINQ operations which is how you can do all kinds of interesting
    actions on a collection of elements. There is a lecture on LINQ in the Advanced
    section.
