  question: What is the primary advice given for becoming proficient with shortcuts
    in Visual Studio?
  optionList:
  - Memorize all shortcuts immediately and use them all the time.
  - Focus on memorizing how to move the cursor quickly and periodically review the
    lecture for more shortcuts.
  - Avoid using the mouse entirely when coding.
  - Only use shortcuts for commenting and uncommenting code.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: "You're not expected to memorize all these shortcuts at once, I've been
    writing code for decades, it took me a long time to learn and remember to use
    all these shortcuts.\r\nSo just memorize the cursor movement shortcuts and then
    come back to this lecture every once in a while and slowly over time you will
    begin to memorize all the other ones. \r\n"
