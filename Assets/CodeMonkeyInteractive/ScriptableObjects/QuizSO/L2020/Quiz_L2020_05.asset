  question: Which shortcut is used for renaming symbols throughout the entire codebase
    efficiently?
  optionList:
  - Ctrl + R + R
  - Ctrl + X
  - Ctrl + C
  - Ctrl + V
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'This is another super useful shortcut, it''s absolutely essential when
    refactoring which is something you should be doing whenever needed.

    If
    you come up with a better name for a variable/function then just take an extra
    second to use this shortcut to rename every instance of that symbol.
