  question: What is the purpose of using the Ctrl + Arrow Keys shortcut in Visual
    Studio?
  optionList:
  - To delete text faster.
  - To move the cursor word by word instead of letter by letter, enhancing navigation
    speed.
  - To add new lines of code quickly.
  - To copy and paste code.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'By holding down control and pressing the left/right arrow keys you can
    move word by word instead of letter by letter making it much faster.

    Then
    you can also set up the commands to move vertically like I did.

    With just
    these shortcuts you can move within your codebase extremely fast.
