  question: What does the List<T> class in C# demonstrate about generics?
  optionList:
  - That generics can only be used with built-in types.
  - The ability to create collections that can store any type of data.
  - That all generics are inherently thread-safe.
  - That generics do not support methods like addition or removal of items.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'List is an excellent example of the power of generics. With just one List
    class you can create lists of any type, as opposed to having to define a ListInt,
    ListString, ListFloat, etc.
