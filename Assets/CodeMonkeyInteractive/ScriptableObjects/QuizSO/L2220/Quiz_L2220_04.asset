  question: Which of the following is a benefit of using generics?
  optionList:
  - Increased runtime performance due to type-specific implementations.
  - Reduced code reuse and flexibility.
  - Type safety without the need for casting or type checking.
  - Generics eliminate the need for interfaces.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Generics help you make your code type safe. Technically you could get
    the equivalent of a generic class by just making that class work with the global
    object type, but in doing so you would do a ton of casting and type conversion
    that would likely cause tons of errors.

    By using proper Generics the compiler
    itself will enforce the type rules based on what type you use.
