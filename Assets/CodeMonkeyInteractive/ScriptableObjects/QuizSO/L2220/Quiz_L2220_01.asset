  question: What is the purpose of generics in C#?
  optionList:
  - To allow methods to perform arithmetic operations.
  - To enable classes, methods, and interfaces to operate with any data type.
  - To restrict the data type used in a program to integers.
  - To automatically generate code for different data types.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Generics allow you to write code that can work with a multitude of types.

    The
    simplest example is List<T> which because it is made to work with generics you
    can create lists of any type, there''s no need to make a separate class for each
    type ListInt, ListString, ListFloat, etc.
