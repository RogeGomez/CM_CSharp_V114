  question: What is the main characteristic of the dynamic keyword in C#?
  optionList:
  - The type is checked at compile time.
  - The type is checked at runtime.
  - It can only be used with numeric types.
  - It can only be used with string types.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Dynamic only runs validation during runtime, so while writing you can access
    any field or function and the validation on whether that exists will only happen
    at runtime.
