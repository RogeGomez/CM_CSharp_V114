  question: How does dynamic differ from var in C#?
  optionList:
  - var defines the type at runtime, while dynamic defines the type at compile time.
  - dynamic defines the type at runtime, while var defines the type at compile time.
  - Both var and dynamic define the type at runtime.
  - Both var and dynamic define the type at compile time.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: var is evaluated at compile time, the compiler infers the type based on
    the usage. Whereas dynamic only evaluates the type at runtime when the program
    is running.
