  question: What is required at the end of each case in a switch statement?
  optionList:
  - An if statement.
  - An else statement.
  - A break statement.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'To end each case in a switch you write break;

    However technically
    a return would also work, the difference being a break; continues executing code
    after the switch whereas a return; would terminate that functions execution.
