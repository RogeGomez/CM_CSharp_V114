  question: Can a switch statement be used with numerical values in C#?
  optionList:
  - Yes, but only with integers.
  - Yes, with any numerical type.
  - No, switch statements only work with strings.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Yes you can use a float or double in a switch.

    However because of
    issues with precision you should probably avoid this.

    For example this will
    be false:

    ##REF##code,

    bool b = (1f / 3f) == 0.33f; // false

    ##REF##

    As
    will this

    ##REF##code,

    float oneThird = 1f / 3f;

    bool b = oneThird
    + oneThird + oneThird == 1f; // false

    ##REF##

    It has to do with precision
    which is limited. So while mathematically this should equal to 1, because it''s
    an infinite number 0.33333(3) eventually the memory has to stop so the result
    will not be exactly 1f

    When working with decimals you should avoid direct
    comparisons.
