  question: How can you enforce that a property can be read from anywhere but only
    set within its class?
  optionList:
  - By making the property public and the set accessor private.
  - By declaring the property as static.
  - By using the protected keyword on the property.
  - By only providing a get accessor.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'You define the property as public, you can omit the accessor on the get
    to keep it public, and define the set as private.

    ##REF##code,

    public
    static Instance { get; private set; }

    ##REF##

    This makes it so that
    the property can be set by that class, but other classes can only get it.
