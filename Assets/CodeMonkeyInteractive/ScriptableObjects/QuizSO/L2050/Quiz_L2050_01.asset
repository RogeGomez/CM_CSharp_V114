  question: What are properties in C#?
  optionList:
  - Special methods that are used to access and modify private fields.
  - A mix between a variable and a function, allowing data storage and logic execution.
  - Constants that cannot be changed once set.
  - Data types specific to C# for handling collections.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Properties are a mix between variables and functions. They can store data
    and do logic.

    Athough technically properties don''t really store data,
    they have a backing normal field that is used for storing that data.

    When
    using auto-implemented properties the compiler atomatically creates that backing
    field.
