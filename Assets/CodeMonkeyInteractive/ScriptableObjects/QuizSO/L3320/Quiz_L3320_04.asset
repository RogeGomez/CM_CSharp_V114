  question: Which method should you use if you want assertions to be included in
    both Debug and Release builds?
  optionList:
  - Debug.Assert
  - Trace.Assert
  - Release.Assert
  - Production.Assert
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'If you want assertions in production then you should use Trace.Assert

    Although
    Asserts are mainly used for making sure your code is working as intended, so
    ideally you shouldn''t need asserts in production code.
