  question: What happens if you modify an int parameter inside a function?
  optionList:
  - It modifies the original int that was used as a parameter.
  - It only changes the value within the scope of the function.
  - It causes an error.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'For types like int which are Value types, when you pass it onto a function
    as a parameter you are passing in a copy of the data.

    Therefore when you
    modify that parameter inside the function you are modifying the copy and not
    the original data.

    However this behaviour is different if the type is a
    Reference type like a Class. I cover the differences between Value and Reference
    types in a lecture in the Intermediate section.
