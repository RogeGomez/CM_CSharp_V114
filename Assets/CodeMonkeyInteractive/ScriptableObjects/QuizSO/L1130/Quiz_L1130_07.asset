  question: What does it mean to 'return' a value in a function?
  optionList:
  - To output a value to the console.
  - To end the function's execution and send a value back to the caller.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'return means the function will return some data to the caller, it''s the
    main way to get data out of a function.

    Although you could also do that
    with the out parameter, I cover that in a lecture in the Advanced section.
