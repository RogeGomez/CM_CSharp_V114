  - Placing comments in the wrong place.
  - Using too many multi-line comments.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: "I remember when I started learning programming and someone told me I should
    comment absolutely everything. So I would write comments after every single line
    of code like:\n##REF##code,\r\n// Declare age\r\nint age = 35;\r\n// Test if
    age under 40\r\nif (age < 40) {\r\n\t// Do something when age under 40\r\n}\n##REF##\r\nThese
    are useless comments, they don't provide anything extra other than just noise.\r\nIn
    general you should avoid using comments, meaning before you write a comment try
    to see if your code could become more understandable by just using proper names
    for variables and functions, in many cases just doing that will make the code
    easy to understand.\r\nBut of course sometimes comments are excellent, usually
    more to describe the WHY behind a piece of code as opposed to the WHAT is it
    doing, the WHAT should be obvious by just reading the code.\r\n"
