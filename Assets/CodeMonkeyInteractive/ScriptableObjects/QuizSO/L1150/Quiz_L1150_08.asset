  question: Is it a good practice to update comments when the corresponding code
    changes?
  optionList:
  - No, comments should remain unchanged for historical reference.
  - Yes, comments should be updated to reflect changes in the code.
  - No, comments are optional and don't need to be maintained.
  - Yes, but only for multi-line comments.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: "Yes if you modify some piece of code that has an accompanying comment
    you should also update the comment.\r\nThis is also yet another reason why you
    should avoid comments and make your code as self-documenting as possible. \r\nIf
    the code is perfectly understood without comments, then when you need to modify
    something you just need to modify the code.\r\nWhereas if the code relies on
    comments to be understood then if you modify the code you need to remember to
    also modify the comment.\r\n"
