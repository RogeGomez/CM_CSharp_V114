  question: Why should code ideally be self-documented?
  optionList:
  - To avoid the use of comments.
  - Because comments can slow down code execution.
  - To make the code easier to read and understand without relying heavily on comments.
  - Because self-documented code is a requirement in C#.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: "It's much easier to read just Code as opposed to Code + Comments. \r\nSo
    the more you can make your intent clear through the code itself the easier it
    is for someone to understand it.\r\n"
