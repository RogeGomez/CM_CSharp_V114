  answer: "You can write multi-line comments by putting any text you want within
    the start /* and end */ symbols.\r\nThis can also be used in just a single line,
    doesn't have to be multi-line.\n##REF##code,\r\n/*\r\n  This is a\r\n  multi
    line\r\n  comment\r\n*/\r\n\r\n/* This is also a valid comment */\r\n\r\n// And
    technically\r\n// this is also\r\n// a valid multi line comment\r\n##REF##"
