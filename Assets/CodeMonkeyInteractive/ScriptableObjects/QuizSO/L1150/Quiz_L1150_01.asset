  question: What is the purpose of comments in C# code?

  answer: 'Comments are completely ignored by the compiler so they do not impact
    code execution in any way.

    They are used for writing plain text within your
    code to provide extra clarification on whatever it is you''re trying to do.

    However
    before you write any comments you should first ask yourself if the code can be
    readable by just using proper names for your variables and  functions.

    Comments
    are useful and they have their place, but if you have tons of them it''s probably
    a sign that you should write your code more properly.
