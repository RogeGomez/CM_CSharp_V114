  question: How are enums stored in the backend by default?
  optionList:
  - As strings.
  - As boolean values.
  - As integer values.
  - As floating-point numbers.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Enums are really ints with a custom name on top, meaning you can do math
    with Enums which can sometimes be useful like for example making a game tutorial
    where you define an enum for the various Tutorial Stages and you want to go to
    the next stage.
