  question: What is an enum in C#?
  optionList:
  - A special class that allows for the creation of a collection of methods.
  - A data type that enables for variable to be a set of predefined constants.
  - A way to define a set of numeric constants.
  - A feature that allows you to encrypt data within your application.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Enums allow you to define a set of named constants and then use those
    in the code.

    They make the code much more readable as opposed to using
    something like an int and having to memorize what each number represents.
