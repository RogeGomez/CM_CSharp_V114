  question: Which of the following is a valid use case for enums?
  optionList:
  - To encrypt and decrypt data securely.
  - To manage application settings and configurations.
  - To represent a collection of related constants, such as states in a state machine.
  - To dynamically allocate memory for arrays.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'One of the best use cases for enums is as a way to build a simple state
    machine.

    You can define all the various states in an enum, like Idle, LookingForEnemy,
    AttackingEnemy, and do a switch on some state variable to handle the state logic.
