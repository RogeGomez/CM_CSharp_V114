  question: What is one reason why enums are better than integers for representing
    a set of named constants?
  optionList:
  - Enums enforce stronger type-checking at compile time.
  - Enums provide better performance than integers.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Enums have a set of possible values, you cannot set an enum field to a
    value that is not defined within the enum. If you try you get a compile error.

    Whereas
    with numbers you can use any number you want, even numbers that don''t have any
    representation for what you''re trying to do.
