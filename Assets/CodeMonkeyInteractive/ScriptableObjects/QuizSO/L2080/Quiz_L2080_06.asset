  question: What should always be included in a recursive function to ensure it terminates?
  optionList:
  - A break statement within the first line of the function.
  - A conditional statement that leads to a return without a recursive call.
  - A counter that limits the number of recursive calls.
  - A continue statement that skips unnecessary recursion.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'At some point in your recursive logic you need to return without calling
    the function again so that the call stack collapses and the code continues running.
