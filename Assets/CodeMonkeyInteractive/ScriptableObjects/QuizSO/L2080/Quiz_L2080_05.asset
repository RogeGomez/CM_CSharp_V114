  question: How does a recursive function typically handle its parameters to perform
    iterative tasks?
  optionList:
  - By incrementing or modifying the parameters in each call to approach an exit
    condition.
  - By passing the same parameters to each call to maintain consistency.
  - By using static parameters that do not change between calls.
  - By randomly changing parameters to find the optimal solution.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'The parameters in a recursive function need to change in some way so that
    it eventually leads to an exit condition.

    If they never change then chances
    are you have an undersired infinite loop.
