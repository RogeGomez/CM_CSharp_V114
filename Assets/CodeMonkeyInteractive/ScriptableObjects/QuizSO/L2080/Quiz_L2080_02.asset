  question: What can cause a stack overflow error in recursion?
  optionList:
  - Using too many variables within the recursive function.
  - Calling the recursive function with large numbers.
  - The recursive function calling itself way too many times
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'When you call a function the CPU stores a reference in the call stack.
    Since that stack has limited memory, if you call a function too many times without
    returning, like an infinite loop recursion, then at some point the call stack
    will run out of memory and overflow leading to the famous error Stack Overflow.
