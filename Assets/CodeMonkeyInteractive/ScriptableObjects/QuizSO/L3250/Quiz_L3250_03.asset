  question: What is the main difference between an anonymous type and a dynamic type
    in C#?
  optionList:
  - Anonymous types are defined at runtime, while dynamic types are defined at compile
    time.
  - Anonymous types are read-only and defined at compile time, while dynamic types
    are resolved at runtime.
  - Dynamic types are always reference types, while anonymous types are value types.
  - Anonymous types can contain methods, while dynamic types cannot.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Anonymous Types are defined by the compiler at compile time, whereas dynamic
    is only validated at runtime.
