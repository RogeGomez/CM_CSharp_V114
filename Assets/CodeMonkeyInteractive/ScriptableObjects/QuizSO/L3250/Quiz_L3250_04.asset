  question: What happens if you try to modify a property of an anonymous type in
    C#?
  optionList:
  - The property will be modified.
  - A compile-time error occurs because anonymous types are read-only.
  - A runtime error occurs because anonymous types are read-only.
  - The property is ignored and the original value is retained.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: Anonymous types are read-only so you cannot modify them after creation.
