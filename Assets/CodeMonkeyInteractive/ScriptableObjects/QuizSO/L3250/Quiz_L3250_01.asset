  question: What is an anonymous type in C#?
  optionList:
  - A type defined without a name, allowing for the creation of a custom type on
    the fly.
  - A type that can change its definition at runtime.
  - A type that cannot be serialized.
  - A type that only exists in the .NET Framework.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: Anonymous types have no name, they are automatically created by the compiler
    to hold whatever data you define it with.
