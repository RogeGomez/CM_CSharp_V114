  question: In Unity Game Development, which decimal type is most commonly used?
  optionList:
  - double
  - decimal
  - float
  - long
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Most things in Unity use floats.

    The reason is for memory efficiency
    since games are always quite heavy in memory and in most cases you don''t need
    as much precision as a double gives you.
