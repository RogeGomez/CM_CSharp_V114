  question: How can you correctly concatenate strings in C#?
  optionList:
  - Using the * operator
  - Using the + operator
  - Using the / operator
  - Using the && operator
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'To concatenate a string to another you do string + string

    It will
    append one string to the end of the other string.

    Alternatively if you''re
    doing this in a scenario where you need extreme performance, for that you can
    use the <b>StringBuilder</b> class which is built specifically for working with
    strings in a very performant manner.
