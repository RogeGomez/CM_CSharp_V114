  question: What is the result of dividing two int variables in C# like 1/10?
  optionList:
  - 0.1
  - 1
  - 0
  - An error occurs
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If you divide an <b>int</b> by another <b>int</b> the result is an <b>int</b>

    And
    in this case while mathematically the answer is <b>0.1</b>, you cannot store
    that value in an int, so the value is cast down to <b>0</b>

    In order to
    get the correct decimal value you need to cast one of the elements to a float/double/decimal.

    ##REF##code,

    float
    healthNormalized = (float)1 / 10;

    ##REF##'
