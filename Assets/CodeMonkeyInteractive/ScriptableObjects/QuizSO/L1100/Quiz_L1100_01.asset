  question: Which C# data type is used to store whole numbers?
  optionList:
  - double
  - string
  - bool
  - int
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: '<b>int</b> (or integer) is the data type for storing whole numbers.

    If
    you need to store a giant number, something bigger than 2.14 billion, then you
    have <b>long</b> which is also for whole numbers but has more space.

    Or
    for smaller numbers (65k) you have <b>short</b>

    And alternatively for all
    of those you have unsigned versions if you don''t need to store negative numbers.

    ushort,
    uint, ulong
