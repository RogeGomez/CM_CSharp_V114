  question: What keyword is used to generate a fixed pointer to an object that might
    move in memory?
  optionList:
  - lock
  - pin
  - fixed
  - anchor
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'When dealing with objects managed by C# they might move to a different
    location in memory. To prevent this you can use fixed to fix that object to a
    memory position so you can do some work on it.
