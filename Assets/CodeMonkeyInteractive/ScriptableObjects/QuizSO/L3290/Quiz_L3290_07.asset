  question: How would you write a LINQ query to select players from a list whose
    team is "Blue" using query syntax?
  optionList:
  - var blueTeam = playerList.Select(player => player.team == "Blue");
  - var blueTeam = playerList.Where(player => player.team == "Blue").Select(player);
  - var blueTeam = from player in playerList where player.team == "Blue" select player;
  - var blueTeam = from player in playerList select player where player.team == "Blue";
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: You use the from keyword, define a name for the iterator, then from what
    collection to grab it, then the condition and select the element.
