  question: Can a static method in a class access non-static fields of the same class?
  optionList:
  - Yes, always.
  - Yes, but only if the fields are public.
  - No, static methods can only access static fields.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Static functions can only access other static functions or static fields.

    However
    of course if the static function has access to some instance of that class then
    it can go through that class object to access any non-static fields/functions.
