  question: Why might you use a static field in a class?
  optionList:
  - To keep a value that is shared across all instances of the class.
  - To store unique values for each instance of the class.
  - To prevent the field from being modified.
  - To automatically initialize the field for each new instance.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'You define a field as static when that field is meant to be shared across
    all instances of that class.

    For example if you wanted to track number
    of kills for ALL players, you would make that a static field instead of having
    a separate field for each object.
