  question: What does the static keyword mean in C#?
  optionList:
  - The member belongs to an instance of the class.
  - The member belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance.
  - The member is constant and unchangeable.
  - The member is private and cannot be accessed outside the class.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: "By making something static you are saying that symbol belongs to the class
    itself and not any instance of that class.\r\nSo if you make a static function/field
    you access it through the class name and not through any object instance of that
    class.\n##REF##code,\r\npublic class Player {\r\n    public static int totalPlayerCount;\r\n}\r\n--------------------\r\nPlayer
    player = new Player();\r\nplayer.totalPlayerCount++; // Error!\r\nPlayer.totalPlayerCount++;
    // Correct!\r\n##REF##"
