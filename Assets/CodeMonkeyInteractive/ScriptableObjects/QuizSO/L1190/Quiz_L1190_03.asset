  question: How do you call a static function?
  optionList:
  - By creating an instance of the class and calling the function on the instance.
  - Directly on the class without needing an instance.
  - By using a special keyword staticCall.
  - It cannot be called; it runs automatically.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'You call static functions through the class name itself and not through
    any instance of that class.
