  question: What happens if you declare a class as static?
  optionList:
  - You can create multiple instances of the class.
  - The class cannot contain any non-static members.
  - The class can only contain private members.
  - The class automatically becomes a subclass.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'If you mark a class as static then every member inside that class must
    be marked as static.

    If you want to mix static and non-static members then
    don''t define the class itself as static.

'
