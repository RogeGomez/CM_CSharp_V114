  question: What is the primary characteristic of a Stack collection?
  optionList:
  - Elements are accessed in the order they were added (FIFO).
  - Elements are sorted automatically when added.
  - Elements are accessed in reverse order from how they were added (FILO).
  - Each element in the collection must be unique.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Stack is a FILO collection, First In Last Out, so the last element to
    be added is the first element to be grabbed.
