  answer: 'If you''re an intermediate/advanced user you can take some time to try
    to improve the code quality and readibility of this mini project.

    The player
    class should really only be responsible for the player itself and not the entire
    game logic.

    The collisions would work better with physics.

    The UI
    logic should be handled using an event.
