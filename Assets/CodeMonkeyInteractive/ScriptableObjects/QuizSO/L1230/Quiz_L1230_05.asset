  question: According to the lecture, why are only a few comments used in the project's
    script?
  optionList:
  - Comments are not supported in Unity C# scripts.
  - The code is written with clear names for functions and variables, making it self-documenting.
  - Comments are reserved for complex code only.
  - The project is too simple to require comments.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The code is all written with proper names that makes it very easy to understand
    what the code is doing by just reading the code itself.

    However there are
    still some comments used when the code itself cannot be made easier to understand.

    Remember
    that comments are not bad. You should avoid them in favor of writing good clean
    code, but in some cases they are a very useful tool.
