  question: How is the coin pickup logic implemented in the game?
  optionList:
  - Using a physics collision system.
  - Through distance checks in a loop.
  - By triggering an animation.
  - By using a raycast to detect coins.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'One regular occurence in all of programming is how every problem has many
    possible solutions.

    In this project I used a simple distance check to test
    for collisions in order to demonstrate loops in action.

    However yup I could
    have used physics for collision detection as well. One problem, multiple possible
    solutions.
