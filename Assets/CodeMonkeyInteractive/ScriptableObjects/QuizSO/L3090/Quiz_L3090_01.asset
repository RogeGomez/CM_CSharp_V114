  question: What is the primary use of expression-bodied members in C#?
  optionList:
  - To execute multiple complex functions simultaneously
  - To write compact code for single instruction members
  - To create multi-threaded applications
  - To define large classes with many methods
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'This is a syntax that helps you write single instructions in a very compact
    manner.

    The fact that it''s limited to a single instruction means it does
    not negatively impact readability.'
