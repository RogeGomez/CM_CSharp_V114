  question: How can you access a class from a specific namespace without the using
    directive?
  optionList:
  - By declaring the class as public
  - By instantiating the class using the new keyword
  - By prefixing the class name with the namespace
  - By creating an alias for the class
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If you don''t want to add the using, or if there is a naming conflict,
    you can just use the entire type name including the namespace.
