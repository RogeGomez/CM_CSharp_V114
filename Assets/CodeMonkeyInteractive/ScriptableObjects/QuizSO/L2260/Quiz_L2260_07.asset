  question: When might you choose to use the full namespace path instead of a using
    directive?
  optionList:
  - When the namespace name is very short
  - When you want to make the code less readable
  - When dealing with namespace name collisions
  - When the class is used only once in the code
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'You need to use the full name if there is a collision.

    If not then
    it''s up to you to add the using statement or not, in most cases it is helpful
    to add it, it makes your code more compact and enhances readability.
