  question: What is one great benefit of using namespaces?
  optionList:
  - They allow for the use of identical class names within different namespaces
  - They automatically make all classes within them public
  - They reduce the memory usage of a program
  - They enable multiple inheritance in classes
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'By defining namespaces you can have multiple classes with the exact same
    class name, as long as they exist on different namespaces.

    For example
    there is a Random class defined inside System and another one defined inside
    UnityEngine.
