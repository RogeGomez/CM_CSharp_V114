  question: How can you resolve a naming conflict between two classes with the same
    name but in different namespaces?
  optionList:
  - By using the full name (namespace.classname) to specify which one you want to
    use
  - By using the override keyword
  - By declaring both classes in a new, common namespace
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'If two classes have the exact same name and you have using statements
    for both namespaces then you can specify which one you are referring to by just
    using the full name, namespace.className like System.Random or UnityEngine.Random;
