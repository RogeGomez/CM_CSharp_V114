  question: What happens if an object does not match any case in a switch statement
    using pattern matching?
  optionList:
  - The program throws a runtime exception.
  - The switch statement is skipped, and no code is executed.
  - The code in the default case is executed if it is provided.
  - The first case statement is executed as a fallback.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'If none of the cases match then it will run the code in the default block,
    if no default is defined then it just continues running code after the switch.
