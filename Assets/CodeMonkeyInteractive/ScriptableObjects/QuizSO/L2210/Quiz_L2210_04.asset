  question: What is a common use case for events in game development?
  optionList:
  - To perform all game logic updates in a single update loop.
  - To create a loose coupling between UI elements and game logic, such as updating
    a health bar when a player takes damage.
  - To store and manage game data in a central location.
  - To directly manipulate game objects from user input devices.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The most straightforward use case in game development is for updating
    the UI.

    By using events your game logic is completely decoupled from the
    UI, it can work with or without a UI on top, making the code less complex and
    easier to understand.
