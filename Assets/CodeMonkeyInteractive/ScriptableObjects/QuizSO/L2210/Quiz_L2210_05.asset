  question: What must be done before invoking an event to avoid exceptions?
  optionList:
  - Initializing the event with a default function.
  - Checking if the event is null to ensure it has subscribers.
  - Subscribing at least one function to the event.
  - Declaring the event as static.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Before firing the event you must check if it''s not null to test if it
    has subscribers.

    If you don''t and there are no listeners it will fire
    a NullReferenceException since the event will be null when it has no subscribers.
