  question: What is the significance of event publishers being decoupled from subscribers?
  optionList:
  - It allows events to be reused across different applications.
  - It ensures that subscribers can directly invoke events.
  - It enables the publisher to execute subscriber methods directly.
  - It allows the publisher to notify subscribers of changes without knowing the
    details of the subscribers.
  correctOptionIndex: 3
  answer: 'This is one of the main benefits of events, it''s how the publisher does
    not know anything about any subscribers, it is completely decoupled from them.
    It works whether there are 0 subscribers or 1000, it works whether those subscribers
    do something really complex with the event or nothing at all.
