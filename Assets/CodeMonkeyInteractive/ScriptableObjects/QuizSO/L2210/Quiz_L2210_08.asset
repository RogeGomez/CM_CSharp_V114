  question: What limitation does the event keyword add to a delegate?
  optionList:
  - It prevents the delegate from being invoked outside the class it's defined in.
  - It restricts the delegate to only work with static methods.
  - It limits the delegate to a single subscriber.
  - It automatically unsubscribes all methods when the application closes.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'By adding the event keyword you ensure that the event can only be fired
    by the class that defines the event.

    Also other classes cannot set the
    event to null, they can only += and -=
