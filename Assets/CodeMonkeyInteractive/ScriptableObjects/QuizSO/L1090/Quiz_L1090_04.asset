  question: What does the statement age++; do?
  optionList:
  - Resets the value of age to 0.
  - Divides the value of age by itself.
  - Increases the value of age by 1.
  - Multiplies the value of age by 2.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'This is the shorthand for increasing the value stored in the variable
    by 1.

    It''s a super useful shorthand, especially when working with for Loops
    which we will cover in a future lecture.

    These are the two shorthands

    ##REF##code,

    age++;

    age--;

    ##REF##

    But
    these two for multiplication and division don''t exist

    ##REF##code,

    age**;
    // Error!

    age//; // Error!

    ##REF##

    If you want to do those two
    or increment/decrement by more than one you can use this similar shorthand

    ##REF##code,

    age
    += 2;

    age -= 2;

    age *= 2;

    age /= 2;

    ##REF##'
