  question: How can you modify the value of a variable?
  optionList:
  - By assigning a new value to the variable.
  - By using the modify keyword.
  - By re-declaring the variable with a new value.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'You can define a variable, and then assign an new value to replace the
    previous value

    ##REF##code,

    int age = 35;

    age = 25;

    ##REF##

    You
    don''t redeclare it, if you do you get an error since you cannot define two variables
    in the same scope with the exact same name

    ##REF##code,

    int age = 35;

    int
    age = 25; // Error! ''age'' is already defined!

    ##REF##

    However you
    can have multiple variables of the same name as long as they are on completely
    separate scopes, there is a detailed lecture on Scope later on in the course.
