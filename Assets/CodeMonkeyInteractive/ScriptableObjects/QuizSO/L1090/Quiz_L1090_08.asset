  question: What does the statement age *= 2; do?
  optionList:
  - Divides the value of age by 2
  - Increments the value of age by 2
  - Multiplies the value of age by 2
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'The asterisk ''*'' means multiplication and this syntax is the shorthand
    to do some math to the function on the left side

    So these two lines of code
    are doing the exact same thing.

    ##REF##code,

    age *= 2;

    age = age
    * 2;

    ##REF##'
