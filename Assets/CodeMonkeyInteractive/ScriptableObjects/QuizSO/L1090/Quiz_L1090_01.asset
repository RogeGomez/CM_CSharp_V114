  question: What is the primary purpose of a variable in C#?
  optionList:
  - To name a function
  - To store data
  - To execute commands
  - To create new data types
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Variables are containers for data.

    You define the variable and then
    put inside whatever value you want (based on the data type)

    Then you can
    write code that uses that variable in some way, and when that code executes it
    goes inside the variable container, grabs the value that is stored inside and
    uses that value to continue running the code.
