  question: Is it possible to declare multiple variables in one line?
  optionList:
  - Yes, by separating them with a comma.
  - No, each variable must be declared on a separate line.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Yup you can define multiple variables in one line like this:

    int
    age, int health, bool isPlayer, float moveSpeed;

    Although while this is
    valid code personally I tend to avoid doing this because I feel it makes the
    code more confusing.

    So while you can do it, personally I would always define
    each variable in a separate line to keep the code nice and readable.'
