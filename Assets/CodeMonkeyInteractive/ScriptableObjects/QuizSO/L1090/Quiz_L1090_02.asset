  question: Which of the following is a correct way to declare an integer variable?
  optionList:
  - integer age = 35;
  - int age = 35;
  - Int age = 35;
  - INT age = 35;
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'Always be VERY CAREFUL with how code is case sensitive.

    ''int'' and
    ''Int'' might look similar but they are two completely different things.

    The
    biggest mistake that beginners make is writing code carelessly and then have
    no idea why it isn''t working. So always pay very very close attention to capitalization
    and write the code exactly as it should be.
