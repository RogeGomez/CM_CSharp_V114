  question: What is the purpose of a finally block in C#?
  optionList:
  - To finally throw the exception after it's been caught.
  - To execute code after an exception is thrown, whether an exception is caught
    or not.
  - To declare final types that cannot be inherited.
  - To execute code only if no exceptions were thrown in the try block.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The finally block will run wether the exception is caught or not or there''s
    no exception. It will always run even if there is a a return; statement in the
    try or catch.
