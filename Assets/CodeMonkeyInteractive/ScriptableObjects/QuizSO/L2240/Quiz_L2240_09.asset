  question: Which of the following can be used to catch multiple types of exceptions?
  optionList:
  - Defining multiple catch blocks one after another.
  - Using the when keyword to specify conditions.
  - Listing exception types separated by commas.
  - It is not possible to catch multiple types of exceptions in a single block.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'You can define multiple catch blocks each with different exception types.

    Just
    make sure you go top down from more specific to more general.

    For example
    first try to catch NullReferenceException and then try to catch the general Exception.
