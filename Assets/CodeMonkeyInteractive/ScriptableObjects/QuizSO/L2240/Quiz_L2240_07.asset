  question: When should you use a finally block?
  optionList:
  - When you need to catch additional exceptions not caught by previous catch blocks.
  - When you want to execute cleanup code or ensure some actions are performed regardless
    of exceptions.
  - When you need to execute code before the try block.
  - Finally blocks are optional and should never be used for clarity.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The finally block is great for general clean up that you want to make
    sure happens whether the code runs fine or runs into an exception, for example
    closing an opened File stream.
