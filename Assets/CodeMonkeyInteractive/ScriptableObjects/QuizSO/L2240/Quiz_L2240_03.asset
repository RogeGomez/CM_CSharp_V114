  question: How does a catch block work in exception handling in C#?
  optionList:
  - It prevents exceptions from being thrown.
  - It catches and ignores all exceptions, allowing the program to continue.
  - It catches specific or general exceptions thrown in the associated try block.
  - It automatically fixes the cause of exceptions.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'The catch block attempts to catch whatever exception happened. You can
    define multiple catch blocks for various exception types, and a general Exception
    to catch all exceptions since they all extend from that base class.
