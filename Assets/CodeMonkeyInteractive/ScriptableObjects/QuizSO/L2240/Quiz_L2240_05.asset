  optionList:

  - Custom exceptions cannot be thrown and are for informational purposes only.
  - Throwing an exception creates an error condition that can be caught by a catch
    block.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Throwing an exception with throw new Exception(); will throw an exception
    that can then be caught with a catch.

    You can also define your own custom
    exceptions, just define a class that inherits from Exception.
