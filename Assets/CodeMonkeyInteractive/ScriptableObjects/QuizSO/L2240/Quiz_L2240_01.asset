  question: What happens in a C# program when an exception is thrown and not caught?
  optionList:
  - The program continues execution from the next line after the exception.
  - The program executes a default catch block if one is not defined.
  - The program terminates immediately.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'In a console app, if the exception isn''t handled at all then the program
    terminates.

    However in Unity it will stop execution of that Update() and
    skip to the next frame, it won''t automatically crash the game but it will lead
    to tons of strange errors.
