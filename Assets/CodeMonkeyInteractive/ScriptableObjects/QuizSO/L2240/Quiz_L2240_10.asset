  question: Why is it important to catch exceptions in a program?
  optionList:
  - To prevent the compiler from detecting errors.
  - To ensure that the program can gracefully handle errors and potentially recover
    from them.
  - Catch blocks are mainly used for debugging purposes and can be omitted in production
    code.
  - To improve the program's performance by avoiding unnecessary checks.
  correctOptionIndex: 1
  answer: 'The goal of exception handling is to know when something went wrong and
    gracefully handle that error in a way that, if possible, allows the program to
    continue executing without crashing.
