  question: 'What is the result of combining the null conditional and null coalescing
    operators in this context?

    Player player = null;

    string playerName
    = player?.Name ?? "Unknown";'
  optionList:
  - playerName will be set to "Unknown" if player is null.
  - playerName will be set to null.
  - The code will throw a NullReferenceException.
  - playerName will remain uninitialized.
  correctOptionIndex: 0
  answer: 'Remember how the result of the null conditional operator is null if the
    object is null.

    So when using it in combination with the null-coalescing
    operator you can chain some interesting logic.
