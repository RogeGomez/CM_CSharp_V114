  question: 'What will this code do?

    Player player = null;

    player ??= new
    Player();'
  optionList:
  - This code will throw an error because player is null.
  - This code will do nothing because player is already initialized.
  - This code will initialize player with a new Player object if player is null.
  - This code is incorrect and will not compile.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: This code defines a player as null, then the null-coalescing operator will
    test that player is null and because it is it will assign it to a new Player();
