  question: How is the Singleton instance typically accessed?
  optionList:
  - Using a public static function that returns the instance.
  - By instantiating the class using a public constructor.
  - Through a public static property.
  - By calling a special Singleton constructor provided by C#.
  correctOptionIndex: 2
  answer: 'Usually singletons are implemented through a property with a public get
    and either a private set or no set.

    Although technically you could also
    just have a normal Get() function to get the singleton reference.
